WHAT IS GOD’S
PURPOSE FOR US?
WHEN you read the newspaper,
watch television, or listen to the radio, you see and hear many stories
of crime, war, and terrorism. Perhaps you personally are su?ering
because of an illness or because
someone you love has died.

Ask yourself:
? Is this what God wants
for me and my family?
? Where can I ?nd help
to cope with my problems?
? Will there ever be real peace?

The Bible provides convincing
answers to those questions.

THE BIBLE TEACHES
THAT GOD WILL DO
AMAZING THINGS
ON THE EARTH.
People will no longer feel pain,
grow old, or die.—Revelation 21:4

“The lame
will leap like
the deer.”
—Isaiah 35:6

“The eyes of
the blind
will be
opened.”
—Isaiah 35:5

The dead will be
brought back to life.
—John 5:28, 29

No one
will get sick.
—Isaiah 33:24

Everyone on earth will
have plenty to eat.
—Psalm 72:16

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

BENEFIT FROM WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES

It would be easy to
think that what you
have read in the ?rst few
pages of this book is just
a dream. But God has
promised to make those
changes on the earth
very soon, and the Bible explains how he will
do so.
The Bible does more
than that. It tells us
what we need to know
in order to be truly happy and enjoy life right
now. Think for a moment about the things that make you worry. These
may include money or family matters, bad health, or
the death of someone you love. The Bible can help
you to cope with these problems, and it can comfort
you by answering such questions as these:
? Why do we su?er?
? How can we cope with our problems?
? Can our family be happy?
? What happens to us when we die?
? Will we ever see our dead loved ones again?
? Why can we be con?dent that God will do
everything that he has promised?

WHAT IS GOD’S PURPOSE FOR US?

The fact that you are reading this book shows that
you want to know what the Bible teaches. This book
will help you. There are questions for the paragraphs,
which will help you understand the Bible better. Millions of people have enjoyed discussing the Bible
with Jehovah’s Witnesses. We hope you will too. May
God bless you as you discover what the Bible can
teach you!

GET TO KNOW YOUR BIBLE
THE Bible contains 66 books and letters. Each one is divided into chapters and verses. This makes it easy to ?nd a
verse. When this publication cites a scripture, the ?rst number after the name of the Bible book indicates the chapter,
and the following number refers to the verse. For example,
if you see “2 Timothy 3:16,” it means the second letter to
Timothy, chapter 3, verse 16.
When you look up the scriptures cited, you will quickly
become familiar with the Bible. You could also start reading the Bible each day. If you read three to ?ve chapters a
day, you can read the entire Bible in a year.

CHAPTER ONE

WHO IS GOD?
CHILDREN ask lots of questions. You may explain
something to them, but they often ask, ‘Why?’ And
when you try to give them an answer, they may ask,
‘But why?’
2 Whether we are young or old, we all have questions. We may have questions about what we will eat
or wear or buy. Or we may have important questions
about life and the future. But when we don’t ?nd satisfying answers to these questions, we may stop looking for answers.
3 Does the Bible have the answers to the important questions we ask? Some people may think so,
but they feel that the Bible is too hard to understand. They may think that only teachers or priests
have the answers. And others are too ashamed to admit that they don’t know the answers. What do you
think?
4 You probably want answers to questions, such as:
Why am I here? What will happen to me when I die?
What is God like? Jesus, the famous Teacher, said:
“Keep on asking, and it will be given you; keep on
seeking, and you will ?nd; keep on knocking, and it

important questions?

will be opened to you.” (Matthew 7:7) Don’t give up
until you ?nd answers that you can trust.
5 Yes, if you “keep on seeking,” you will ?nd the
answers in the Bible. (Proverbs 2:1-5) These answers
are not too hard to understand. What you learn will
give you a happier life right now and a wonderful
hope for the future. Let’s talk about one question
that has confused many people.
DOES GOD CARE ABOUT US OR IS HE CRUEL?
6

Many people think that God doesn’t care about
us. They feel that if God really cared, the world
would be very di?erent. We see war, hatred, and
misery everywhere. People get sick, they su?er, and
they die. Some wonder, ‘If God cares about us, why
doesn’t he stop all this su?ering?’
7 Religious leaders sometimes make people believe
that God is cruel. When something terrible happens,
they say that it’s God’s will. They say that he wanted it to happen. When they say this, they are really
blaming God. But the Bible teaches that God is never the source of evil. James 1:13 tells us that God
does not test anyone with evil things. It says: “When
under trial, let no one say: ‘I am being tried [or, tested] by God.’ For with evil things God cannot be tried,
nor does he himself try anyone.” This means that
even though God hasn’t stopped bad things from

happen?

happening, he never makes them happen. (Read Job
34:10-12.) Let’s use an example.
8 Imagine a young man who lives at home with
his parents. His father loves him very much and
has taught him how to make good decisions. Then,
the young man rebels against his father and leaves
home. He does bad things and gets into trouble.
Would you blame the father for what happened because he didn’t stop his son from leaving home?
Of course not! (Luke 15:11-13) Like that father, God
didn’t stop humans when they chose to rebel and do
what is bad. So when something bad happens, we
should remember that God didn’t make it happen. It
would be unfair to blame God.
9 There is a very good reason why God has not yet
stopped bad things from happening. In Chapter 11,
you will learn what the Bible says about this. But you
can be sure that God loves us and that he is never to
blame for our problems. In fact, he is the only One
who can solve them.—Isaiah 33:2.
10 God is holy. (Isaiah 6:3) Everything he does is
pure, clean, and good. So we can trust him. Humans
are not like that. They sometimes do wrong things.
And even the most honest ruler does not have the
power to repair all the damage that bad people do.
No one has as much power as God has. He can and
will repair all the damage that has been done by bad

an example.

has been done by bad people?

people. He will remove all evil forever.—Read Psalm
37:9-11.
HOW DOES GOD FEEL WHEN PEOPLE SUFFER?
11

How does God feel when he sees what is happening in the world and what you are going
through? The Bible teaches that God “loves justice.”
(Psalm 37:28) So he cares deeply about what is right
and what is wrong. He hates it when people su?er.
The Bible says that “his heart was saddened” when
he saw the world ?lled with badness in the past.
(Genesis 6:5, 6) God has not changed. (Malachi 3:6)
The Bible says that God really cares about you.—Read
1 Peter 5:7.
12 The Bible also says that God created us in his image. (Genesis 1:26) This means that God made us
with the same good qualities that he has. So if you
feel bad when you see innocent people su?er, God
must feel even worse when he sees it! How do we
know this?
13 The Bible teaches us that “God is love.” (1 John
4:8) Everything God does is motivated by love. So we
love because God loves. Think about this: If you had
the power, would you remove all the su?ering and
injustice in the world? Of course you would, because
you love people. What about God? He has the power,
and because he loves us, he will remove all su?ering
11. How does God feel about your su?ering?

feel about the su?ering in the world? (b) Why can we be sure that
God will remove all su?ering and injustice?

and injustice. You can be sure that every one of God’s
promises mentioned at the beginning of this book
will come true! But to be able to trust these promises, you need to know more about God.
GOD WANTS YOU TO KNOW HIM
14

If you want to be someone’s friend, what’s the
?rst thing you usually tell him? Your name. Does
God have a name? Many religions say his name is
God or Lord, but these are not names. They are
just titles, like “king” or “president.” God has told
us that his name is Jehovah.
Psalm 83:18 says: “May peoIf you want to
be someone’s friend,
ple know that you, whose
you tell him your
name is Jehovah, you alone
name. God tells us his
are the Most High over all
name in the Bible
the earth.” Bible writers
used God’s name thousands
of times. Jehovah wants
you to know his name and
to use it. He tells you his
name so that you can become his friend.
15 God’s name, Jehovah,
has deep meaning. It means
that God can ful?ll any
promise he makes and can
accomplish his purpose.
14. What is God’s name, and how
do we know that we should use it?
15. What does the name Jehovah
mean?

The Bible teaches that
Jehovah is the loving Creator
of the universe

Nothing can stop him. Only Jehovah can have this
name.1
16 As we read earlier, Psalm 83:18 says about Jehovah: “You alone are the Most High.” Also, Revelation 15:3 says: “Great and wonderful are your works,

eternity”? (c) “Creator”?

14

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

Jehovah God, the Almighty. Righteous and true are
your ways, King of eternity.” What does the title “the Almighty” mean? It means that Jehovah is
more powerful than anyone else in the universe. And
the title “King of eternity” means that he has always
existed. Psalm 90:2 explains that he is from eternity
to eternity. Isn’t that amazing!
17 Only Jehovah is the Creator. Revelation 4:11
says: “You are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive
the glory and the honor and the power, because
you created all things, and because of your will they
came into existence and were created.” Yes, from the
angels in heaven to the stars in the sky to the fruit on
the trees and to the ?sh in the sea—Jehovah made
everything you can think of!

his children, but

15

CAN YOU BE JEHOVAH’S FRIEND?
18

When some people read about Jehovah’s impressive qualities, they feel afraid and think, ‘God
is so powerful, so important, and so far away, why
would he care about me?’ But is that how God wants
us to feel? Not at all. Jehovah wants to be close to us.
The Bible says that God is “not far o? from each one
of us.” (Acts 17:27) God wants you to draw close to
him, and he promises that “he will draw close to
you.”—James 4:8.
19 How can you become God’s friend? Jesus said:
“This means everlasting life, their coming to know
you, the only true God, and the one whom you sent,
Jesus Christ.” (John 17:3) Keep on learning, and you
will come to know Jehovah and Jesus. And then you
can have everlasting life. For example, we have already
learned that “God is love.” (1 John 4:16) But he also
has many other beautiful qualities. The Bible tells us
that Jehovah is “merciful and compassionate, slow to
anger and abundant in loyal love and truth.” (Exodus
34:6) Jehovah is “good and ready to forgive.” (Psalm
86:5) God is patient and loyal. (2 Peter 3:9; Revelation
15:4) You will learn much more about his beautiful
qualities as you read about him in the Bible.

him? (John 1:18; 4:24; 1 Timothy 1:17) When you
read about Jehovah in the Bible, you get to know him
as a real Person. (Psalm 27:4; Romans 1:20) As you
learn more about Jehovah, you will love him more
and more and you will feel closer to him.
21 You will understand that Jehovah is our Father.
(Matthew 6:9) He gave us life, and he also wants
us to have the best life possible. That is what a
loving father would want for his children. (Psalm
36:9) Yes, the Bible teaches that you can become
Jehovah’s friend. (James 2:23) Imagine that. Jehovah, the Creator of the universe, wants you to be his
friend!
22 Some people may want you to stop studying the
Bible. They may fear that you will change your religion. But don’t let anyone stop you from becoming
Jehovah’s friend. He is the best Friend you could ever
have.
23 As you study the Bible, there will be things that
you don’t understand. Don’t be ashamed to ask questions or to ask for help. Jesus said that we should be
humble, like little children. (Matthew 18:2-4) And
children ask lots of questions. God wants you to ?nd
the answers. So study the Bible carefully to make sure
that what you learn is the truth.—Read Acts 17:11.
24 The best way to learn about Jehovah is to study
the Bible. In the next chapter, we will ?nd out why
the Bible is di?erent from every other book.

THE BIBLE
—A BOOK FROM GOD
HOW do you feel when a friend surprises you with
a gift? You can’t wait to open it, and you are happy that your friend thought of you. You thank him
for it.
2 The Bible is a gift from God. It gives us information that we can’t ?nd anywhere else. For example, it
tells us that God created the heavens, the earth, and
the ?rst man and woman. It gives us principles that
can help us when we have problems. In the Bible, we
learn how God will accomplish his purpose to make
the earth a better place. The Bible is such an exciting
gift!
3 As you study the Bible, you will discover that
God wants you to be his friend. The more you learn
about him, the closer your friendship with him will
become.
4 The Bible has been translated into about 2,600
languages, and billions of copies have been printed.
More than 90 percent of the people in the world
can read the Bible in their own language. And each
week, more than a million people get a Bible! Yes,
there is no other book like the Bible.

The New World Translation of the Holy
Scriptures is available in many languages
5 The Bible is “inspired of God.” (Read 2 Timothy
3:16.) But some may think, ‘The Bible was written
by men, so how can it be from God?’ The Bible answers: “Men spoke from God as they were moved [or,
guided] by holy spirit.” (2 Peter 1:21) This is similar
to a businessman telling his secretary to write a letter. Who is the author of the letter? It is the businessman, not the secretary. In the same way, the Author of the Bible is God, not the men he used to
write it. God guided them to write his thoughts. The
Bible really is “the word of God.”—1 Thessalonians
2:13; see Endnote 2.

5. Why can we say that the Bible is “inspired of God”?

THE BIBLE—A BOOK FROM GOD

21

THE BIBLE IS ACCURATE
6

It took more than 1,600 years to write the Bible.
Its writers lived at di?erent times. Some were welleducated and others were not. For example, one was
a doctor. Others were farmers, ?shermen, shepherds,
prophets, judges, and kings. Even though there
were di?erent writers, all parts of the Bible agree. It
doesn’t say one thing in one chapter and the opposite in another.1
7 The ?rst chapters of the Bible explain how the
world’s problems started, and the last chapters tell us
how God will solve those problems by making the
earth a paradise. The Bible covers thousands of years
of human history and shows that God’s purpose is always accomplished.
8 The Bible wasn’t written to teach science or to be
a school textbook, but what it says about scienti?c
matters is always accurate. That is what we would expect of a book that comes from God. For example,
the book of Leviticus contains God’s instructions on
ways the Israelites could stop disease from spreading.
This was written long before people knew how bacteria and viruses cause disease. The Bible also correctly teaches that the earth hangs on nothing. (Job
26:7) And when most people believed that the earth

not true. See chapter 7 of the book The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s?

was ?at, the Bible said that it was round.—Isaiah
40:22.
9 When the Bible talks about history, it is always
accurate. But many history books are not completely
accurate because the writers were not honest. For example, they did not always write about the times
their nation was defeated in battle. Instead, Bible
writers were honest even when Israel was defeated.
They also wrote about their own mistakes. For example, in the book of Numbers, Moses tells us that he
made a serious mistake and that God had to discipline him for it. (Numbers 20:2-12) The honesty of
Bible writers shows that the Bible comes from God.
This means that we can trust the Bible.
A BOOK FULL OF GOOD ADVICE
10

The Bible is “inspired of God and bene?cial for
teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight.”
(2 Timothy 3:16) Yes, the Bible’s advice is helpful for
us today. Jehovah knows how we are made, so he understands how we think and feel. He knows us better
than we know ourselves, and he wants us to be happy. He knows what is good for us and what is bad
for us.
11 In Matthew chapters 5 to 7, we read very good
advice that Jesus gave on how to be happy, how to get
along with others, how to pray, and how to view

money. Although he gave this advice 2,000 years
ago, it is just as powerful and helpful today.
12 In the Bible, Jehovah also teaches us principles
that help us to have a better family life, to be good
workers, and to live in peace with others. Bible principles can always help us, no matter who we are,
where we live, or what problems we have.—Read Isaiah 48:17; see Endnote 3.
YOU CAN TRUST BIBLE PROPHECY
13

Many Bible prophecies have already come true.
For example, Isaiah prophesied that Babylon would
be destroyed. (Isaiah 13:19) He described exactly
how the city would be defeated. The city was protected by large gates and a river. But Isaiah foretold
that the river would be dried up and the gates left
open. The attackers would take the city without a
battle. Isaiah even prophesied that a man named Cyrus would defeat Babylon.—Read Isaiah 44:27–45:2;
see Endnote 4.
14 Two hundred years after the prophecy was written, an army arrived ready to attack Babylon. Who
was leading the army? Just as the prophecy said, it
was Cyrus, the king of Persia. Everything was set for
the rest of the prophecy to come true.
15 On the night of the attack, the Babylonians
were having a feast. They felt safe because they were
protected by massive walls and a river. Outside the

city, Cyrus and his army dug a channel to lower the
level of the river water. The water level went down
enough for the Persian soldiers to walk through it.
But how would the army get past Babylon’s walls?
Just as the prophecy said, the city gates were left
open, so the soldiers took the city without a battle.

16

Isaiah prophesied that eventually no one would
ever live in Babylon again. He wrote: “She will never
be inhabited, nor will she be a place to reside [or,
live] in throughout all generations.” (Isaiah 13:20)
Did that come true? In the place where Babylon used
to be, about 50 miles south of Baghdad, Iraq, there
are just ruins. Even today, no one lives there. Jehovah
swept Babylon “with the broom of annihilation [or,
destruction].”—Isaiah 14:22, 23.1
17 The fact that so many Bible prophecies have
already come true means that we can trust what
the Bible says about the future. We can be sure that

THE BIBLE CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE
18

We have learned that there is no other book like
the Bible. It is harmonious, and when it talks about
scienti?c or historical matters, it is always accurate. It
also gives us good advice and contains many prophecies that have already come true. But the Bible does
even more than that. The apostle Paul wrote: “The
word of God is alive and exerts power.” What does
that mean?—Read Hebrews 4:12.
19 The Bible can change your life. It can help you
to know who you really are. It can help you to understand your deepest thoughts and feelings. For example, we may think that we love God. But to prove
that we love him, we need to apply what the Bible
says.
20 The Bible truly is a book from God. He wants
you to read it, study it, and love it. Be thankful for
this gift, and keep studying it. Then you will understand God’s purpose for humans. In the next chapter, we will learn more about this purpose.

CHAPTER THREE

WHAT IS GOD’S PURPOSE
FOR HUMANS?
GOD has a wonderful purpose for humans. He created the ?rst man and woman, Adam and Eve, to live
in a beautiful garden. His purpose was for them to
have children, to make the whole earth a paradise,
and to take care of the animals.—Genesis 1:28; 2:8, 9,
15; see Endnote 6.
2 Do you think that we will ever live in a paradise?
Jehovah tells us: “I have purposed it, and I will also
carry it out.” (Isaiah 46:9-11; 55:11) Yes, he will do
what he has purposed, and nothing will stop him. Jehovah says that he created the earth for a reason. He
“did not create it simply for nothing.” (Isaiah 45:18)
He wants people to live all over the earth. What kind
of people does God want to live here, and for how
long? The Bible says: “The righteous [or, obedient]
will possess the earth, and they will live forever on
it.”—Psalm 37:29; Revelation 21:3, 4.
3 But today people get sick and die. In many places,
they ?ght and kill one another. Surely this is not
what God purposed. So, what happened, and why?
Only the Bible can explain.
1. What is God’s purpose for humans?

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

AN ENEMY OF GOD
The Bible tells us that God has an enemy who is
“called Devil and Satan.” Satan used a snake to speak
to Eve in the garden of Eden. (Revelation 12:9; Genesis 3:1) He made it look as though the snake was talking.—See Endnote 7.
5 So, did God create Satan the Devil? No! An angel who had been in heaven when God prepared the
earth for Adam and Eve changed and became the
Devil. (Job 38:4, 7) How was that possible? Well, how
does an honest person change and become a thief?
He was not born a thief. But he desires, or wants,
something that doesn’t belong to him. He keeps
thinking about it, and his wrong desire becomes
stronger. Then, when he gets a chance, he steals it. He
has turned himself into a thief.—Read James 1:13-15;
see Endnote 8.
6 This is what happened to that angel. After Jehovah
created Adam and Eve, he told them to have children
and “?ll the earth.” (Genesis 1:27, 28) That angel may
have thought, ‘All those people could worship me instead of Jehovah!’ The more he thought about it, the
more he desired what belongs to Jehovah. That angel
wanted people to worship him. So he lied to Eve and
misled her. (Read Genesis 3:1-5.) By doing that, he
became Satan the Devil, an enemy of God.
7 Adam and Eve disobeyed God and ate the fruit.

7. (a) Why did Adam and Eve die? (b) Why do we grow old and
die?

WHAT IS GOD’S PURPOSE FOR HUMANS?

31

(Genesis 2:17; 3:6) They sinned against Jehovah, and
in time they died, just as Jehovah had said they
would. (Genesis 3:17-19) Adam and Eve’s children
were sinners, so they died. (Read Romans 5:12.) To
help us understand why Adam and Eve’s children
were also sinners, consider this example. Imagine
baking a loaf of bread in a pan that has a dent. The
bread will have the same dent as the pan. When
Adam disobeyed God, Adam became a sinner. Because we are Adam’s children, all of us are sinners, or
have the same “dent” as he did. And because we are
all sinners, we grow old and die.—Romans 3:23; see
Endnote 9.
8 Satan started a rebellion against Jehovah when he
in?uenced Adam and Eve to disobey God. He wanted Adam and Eve to believe that Jehovah is a liar, a
bad ruler who didn’t want the best for them. Satan
was saying that humans don’t need God to tell them
what to do and that Adam and Eve should decide
for themselves what was right and wrong. So, what
would Jehovah do? He could have killed the rebels
and ended the rebellion. But would that have proved
that Satan is a liar? No, it wouldn’t.
9 Thus, Jehovah didn’t kill the rebels immediately.
Instead, he allowed time for humans to rule themselves. This would make it clear that Satan is a liar
and that Jehovah knows what is best for humans. We
will learn more about that in Chapter 11. But what
do you think about Adam and Eve’s decision? Was
8, 9. (a) What did Satan want Adam and Eve to believe? (b) Why
did Jehovah not kill the rebels immediately?

32

it right for them to believe Satan and disobey God?
Jehovah had given Adam and Eve everything they
had. He gave them perfect life, a beautiful place to
live, and work that they enjoyed. But Satan had never
done anything good for them. If you had been there,
what would you have done?
If all the kingdoms of the world
didn’t belong to Satan, could he
have o?ered them to Jesus?

WHAT IS GOD’S PURPOSE FOR HUMANS?

33

10

Today, each of us has a similar choice to make,
and our life depends on that choice. We can choose
to obey Jehovah as our Ruler and help prove that Satan is a liar. Or we can choose Satan as our ruler.
(Psalm 73:28; read Proverbs 27:11.) Very few people
in this world obey God. In fact, he is not the ruler of
the world. But if God isn’t, who is?
WHO RULES THE WORLD?
Jesus knew who really rules the world. On one
occasion, Satan “showed him all the kingdoms of the
world and their glory.” Then Satan promised Jesus:
“All these things I will give you if you fall [or, bow]
down and do an act of worship to me.” (Matthew 4:
8, 9; Luke 4:5, 6) Ask yourself, ‘If those kingdoms
didn’t belong to Satan, could he have o?ered them to
Jesus?’ No. All governments belong to Satan.
12 You may wonder: ‘How could Satan be the ruler
of the world? Isn’t Jehovah the Almighty God who
created the universe?’ (Revelation 4:11) Yes, he is, but
Jesus clearly called Satan “the ruler of this world.”
(John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11) The apostle Paul called
Satan the Devil “the god of this system of things.”
(2 Corinthians 4:3, 4) And the apostle John wrote
that “the whole world is lying in the power of the
wicked one.”—1 John 5:19.

dangerous. We see wars, corruption, hypocrisy, and
violence all around us. Humans cannot get rid of all
these problems, no matter how hard they try. But
God will soon destroy this wicked world during his
war of Armageddon, and he will replace it with a
righteous new world.—Revelation 16:14-16; see Endnote 10.
14 Jehovah chose Jesus Christ to be the King of His
heavenly government, or Kingdom. Thousands of
years ago, the Bible foretold that Jesus would rule as
“Prince of Peace” and that his government would never end. (Isaiah 9:6, 7) Jesus taught his followers to pray
for this government when he said: “Let your Kingdom
come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also on
earth.” (Matthew 6:10) In Chapter 8, we will learn
how God’s Kingdom will replace the world’s governments. (Read Daniel 2:44.) Then God’s Kingdom will
make the earth into a beautiful paradise.—See Endnote 11.
A NEW WORLD IS NEAR!
The Bible promises: “There are new heavens and
a new earth that we are awaiting,” and “in these righteousness is to dwell.” (2 Peter 3:13; Isaiah 65:17)
Sometimes when the Bible talks about “the earth,” it’s
talking about the people who live on the earth. (Genesis 11:1) So the righteous “new earth” refers to all the
people who obey God and are blessed by him.

the Bible foretell about Jesus?

WHAT IS GOD’S PURPOSE FOR HUMANS?

35

16

Jesus promised that those who live in God’s new
world will be given “everlasting life.” (Mark 10:30)
What must we do to receive this gift? Please read
John 3:16 and 17:3 to ?nd the answer. Let us now see
what the Bible says life will be like in the earthly Paradise.
17 Wickedness, war, crime, and violence will be
gone. There will not be any wicked people left on
earth. (Psalm 37:10, 11) God will bring “an end to wars
throughout the earth.” (Psalm 46:9; Isaiah 2:4) The
earth will be full of people who love God and are obedient to him. There will be peace forever.—Psalm 72:7.
18 Jehovah’s people will feel secure. In Bible times,
when the Israelites obeyed God, they were safe because he protected them. (Leviticus 25:18, 19) In the
Paradise, we will not be afraid of anything or anybody.
We will always feel secure!—Read Isaiah 32:18; Micah 4:4.
19 There will be plenty of food. “There will be an
abundance of grain on the earth; on the top of the
mountains it will over?ow.” (Psalm 72:16) Jehovah,
“our God, will bless us,” and “the earth will give its
produce.”—Psalm 67:6.
20 The whole earth will become a paradise. People
will have beautiful houses and gardens. (Read Isaiah

world, and what must we do to receive this gift?

the earth and that we will feel secure?

20. How do we know that the earth will become a paradise?

36

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

65:21-24; Revelation 11:18.) The whole earth will be
as beautiful as the garden of Eden was. Jehovah will always give us everything that we need. The Bible says
about him: “You open your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.”—Psalm 145:16.
21 There will be peace between humans and animals. Animals will not harm humans anymore. Little
children will feel safe, even around animals that are
dangerous to us today.—Read Isaiah 11:6-9; 65:25.
22 No one will be sick. When Jesus was on earth,
he healed many people. (Matthew 9:35; Mark 1:4042; John 5:5-9) But as King of God’s Kingdom, Jesus
will heal everyone. No one will ever say: “I am sick.”
—Isaiah 33:24; 35:5, 6.
23 The dead will live again. God promises that
he will resurrect millions of people who have died.
“There is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.”—Read John 5:28, 29;
Acts 24:15.
24 We all have a choice. We can choose to learn
about Jehovah and serve him, or we can just do what
we want to do. If we choose to serve Jehovah, we can
have a wonderful future. When a man asked Jesus
to remember him after he died, Jesus promised him:
“You will be with me in Paradise.” (Luke 23:43) Let us
learn more about Jesus Christ and how he will make
God’s wonderful promises come true.

CHAPTER FOUR

WHO IS
JESUS CHRIST?
THERE are many famous people in the world. You
may know the name of someone famous. But just because you know his name doesn’t mean that you
know him well. It doesn’t mean that you know every
detail about his life and what he is really like.
2 You may have heard about Jesus Christ, even
though he lived on earth about 2,000 years ago. But
most people do not know what Jesus was like as a person. Some say he was a good man, some say he was a
prophet, and some believe that he is God. What do
you think?—See Endnote 12.
3 It is important for you to know the truth about
Jesus. Why? The Bible tells us: “This means everlasting life, their coming to know you, the only true
God, and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.”
(John 17:3) Yes, if you know the truth about Jehovah and Jesus, you can live forever on a paradise
earth. (John 14:6) Also, knowing about Jesus will
help you because he is the best example of how to
live and treat others. (John 13:34, 35) In Chapter 1,
we learned the truth about God. Now we will learn
what the Bible teaches about Jesus.
1, 2. (a) Do you really know someone famous if you know only his
name? Explain. (b) What do people believe about Jesus?
3. Why is it important for you to know Jehovah God and Jesus
Christ?

WHO IS JESUS CHRIST?

41

WE HAVE FOUND
THE MESSIAH!
4

Many years before Jesus was born, Jehovah
promised in the Bible that he would send the Messiah, or Christ. The word “Messiah” comes from the
Hebrew language, and the word “Christ” comes from
the Greek. Both of these titles mean that God would
choose the promised Messiah and give him a special
position. The Messiah will make all of God’s promises come true. Jesus can also help you right now. But
before Jesus was born, many people wondered, ‘Who
will be the Messiah?’
5 Jesus’ disciples had no doubt that he was the
promised Messiah. (John 1:41) For example, Simon
Peter said to Jesus: “You are the Christ.” (Matthew 16:
16) How can we be sure that Jesus is the Messiah?
6 Long before Jesus was born, God’s prophets
wrote down many details that would help people
?nd the Messiah. How would this help? Suppose
you were asked to go to a busy bus station to pick
up a person you had never met. If someone gave
you a good description of that person, you would be
able to ?nd him. In the same way, Jehovah used his
prophets to tell us about what the Messiah would do
and what would happen to him. The ful?llment of
all those prophecies helps sincere people to know
that Jesus is the Messiah.
4. What do the words “Messiah” and “Christ” mean?
5. Did Jesus’ disciples believe that he was the Messiah?
6. How did Jehovah help sincere people to identify the Messiah?

7

Here are two of those prophecies. First, 700 years
before Jesus was born, Micah prophesied that the
Messiah would be born in the small town of Bethlehem. (Micah 5:2) And that’s where Jesus was born!
(Matthew 2:1, 3-9) Second, Daniel prophesied that
the Messiah would appear in the year 29 C.E. (Daniel
9:25) These are just two of the many prophecies that
clearly prove that Jesus is the promised Messiah.—See
Endnote 13.
8 Jehovah has made it very clear that Jesus is the
Messiah. God promised to give John the Baptizer a
sign so that he would know who the Messiah was.
When Jesus went to John to get baptized in the Jordan River in the year 29 C.E., John saw that sign.
The Bible tells us what happened: “After being baptized, Jesus immediately came up from the water;
and look! the heavens were opened up, and he saw
God’s spirit descending like a dove and coming upon
him. Look! Also, a voice from the heavens said: ‘This
is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.’ ”
(Matthew 3:16, 17) When John saw and heard this
sign, he knew that Jesus was the Messiah. (John 1:3234) On that day, when Jehovah poured out his spirit

on him, Jesus became the Messiah. He was the one
whom God had chosen to be Leader and King.—Isaiah 55:4.
9 Bible prophecies, Jehovah’s own words, and the
sign He gave at Jesus’ baptism prove that Jesus is the
Messiah. But where did Jesus come from, and what
was he like? Let us see what the Bible says.

At his baptism, Jesus became
the Messiah, or Christ

44

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

WHERE DID JESUS COME FROM?
10

The Bible teaches that Jesus lived in heaven for
a long time before he came to earth. Micah said that
the Messiah was “from ancient times.” (Micah 5:2)
Jesus himself said many times that he had lived in
heaven before being born as a human. (Read John 3:
13; 6:38, 62; 17:4, 5.) Even before coming to earth,
Jesus had a special relationship with Jehovah.
11 Jesus is very precious to Jehovah. Why? Because
God created him before everything and everyone
else. So Jesus is called “the ?rstborn of all creation.”1
(Colossians 1:15) Jesus is also precious to Jehovah because he is the only one Jehovah created directly.
That is why he is called the “only-begotten Son.”
(John 3:16) Jesus is also the only one Jehovah used to
create all other things. (Colossians 1:16) And only Jesus is called “the Word,” because Jehovah used him
to give messages and instructions to angels and humans.—John 1:14.
12 Some people believe that Jesus and God are the
same person. But that’s not what the Bible teaches.
The Bible says that Jesus was created, which means
that Jesus had a beginning. But Jehovah, who created
1 Jehovah is called a Father because he is the Creator. (Isaiah
64:8) Jesus is called God’s Son because Jehovah created him. Angels, as well as the man Adam, are also called sons of God.—Job 1:6;
Luke 3:38.

earth?

45

all things, had no beginning. (Psalm 90:2) As God’s
Son, Jesus never thought of trying to be God. The Bible clearly teaches that the Father is greater than the
Son. (Read John 14:28; 1 Corinthians 11:3.) Only Jehovah is “God Almighty.” (Genesis 17:1) He is the
greatest and most powerful person in the universe.
—See Endnote 14.
13 Jehovah and his Son, Jesus, worked closely together for billions of years before the heavens and
the earth were created. They must have loved each
other very much! (John 3:35; 14:31) Jesus imitated his father’s qualities so well that the Bible calls
him “the image of the invisible God.”—Colossians
1:15.
14 Jehovah’s precious Son was willing to leave
heaven and be born on earth as a human. How
was that possible? Jehovah miraculously transferred
his Son’s life from heaven to the womb of a virgin
named Mary. In this way, Jesus did not need to have
a human father. So Mary gave birth to a perfect son,
and she called him Jesus.—Luke 1:30-35.
WHAT WAS JESUS LIKE?
15

You can learn a lot about Jesus, his life, and
his qualities by reading the Bible books of Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John. Those books are called the
Gospels. Because Jesus is just like his Father, what

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

you read will also help you come to know Jehovah
better. That is why Jesus could say: “Whoever has
seen me has seen the Father also.”—John 14:9.
16 Many people called Jesus “Teacher.” (John 1:38;
13:13) One of the most important things that he
taught was “the good news of the Kingdom.” What is
this Kingdom? It is God’s government that will rule
over the entire earth from heaven and bring blessings to people who obey God. (Matthew 4:23) Everything Jesus taught came from Jehovah. Jesus said:
“What I teach is not mine, but belongs to him who
sent me.” (John 7:16) Jesus knew that Jehovah wants
people to hear the good news that God’s Kingdom
will rule over the earth.
17 Where did Jesus teach? Everywhere he found
people. He taught in the countryside as well as in cities, villages, markets, places of worship, and people’s
homes. He didn’t expect people to come to him. He
often went to them. (Mark 6:56; Luke 19:5, 6) Jesus
worked hard and spent much time and energy teaching people. Why? Because he knew that God wanted
him to do that and because he always obeyed his
Father. (John 8:28, 29) Jesus also preached because
he felt compassion for people. (Read Matthew 9:35,
36.) He could see that the religious leaders were not
teaching the truth about God and his Kingdom. So
he wanted to help as many as possible to hear the
good news.

18

Jesus was a man who loved people and cared
for them. He was kind and easy to talk to. Even
children liked to be with him. (Mark 10:13-16) Jesus
was always fair. He hated corruption and injustice.
(Matthew 21:12, 13) He lived at a time when women
didn’t have many rights and were not treated with respect. But Jesus always treated women with respect
and dignity. (John 4:9, 27) Jesus was also truly humble. For example, one evening he washed the feet of
his apostles, something that was normally done by a
servant.—John 13:2-5, 12-17.
19 Jesus knew what people really needed, and he
wanted to help them. This was very clear when he
used God’s power to heal people miraculously. (Matthew 14:14) For example, a man with leprosy came to
Jesus and said: “If you just want to, you can make me
clean.” Jesus was moved by this man’s pain and suffering. He felt sorry for him and wanted to help him.
So Jesus stretched out his hand, touched the man,
and said to him: “I want to! Be made clean.” And the
sick man was healed! (Mark 1:40-42) Can you imagine how that man must have felt?
ALWAYS FAITHFUL TO HIS FATHER
20

Jesus is the best example of obedience to God.
No matter what happened or what his enemies did
to him, he was faithful to his Father. For example,
Jesus did not sin when Satan tried to tempt him.

(Matthew 4:1-11) Some of Jesus’ own family didn’t
believe he was the Messiah and said that he was “out
of his mind,” but Jesus kept doing God’s work. (Mark
3:21) When his enemies were cruel to him, Jesus
stayed faithful to God and never tried to harm them.
—1 Peter 2:21-23.
21 Even when Jesus su?ered a cruel and painful
death, he stayed faithful to Jehovah. (Read Philippians 2:8.) Imagine how much he had to endure on
the day he died. He was arrested, false witnesses accused him of blasphemy, corrupt judges condemned
him, mobs laughed at him, and soldiers tortured
him and nailed him to a stake. When he was dying

49

he cried out: “It has been accomplished!” (John 19:
30) Three days after Jesus died, Jehovah resurrected
him and gave him a spirit body. (1 Peter 3:18) A few
weeks later, Jesus returned to heaven, “sat down at
the right hand of God,” and waited for God to make
him King.—Hebrews 10:12, 13.
22 Because Jesus remained faithful to his Father,
we now have the opportunity to live forever on a paradise earth, just as Jehovah purposed. In the next
chapter, we will discuss how Jesus’ death makes it
possible for us to live forever.

CHAPTER FIVE

THE RANSOM
—GOD’S GREATEST GIFT
WHAT is the best gift you have ever received? A gift
doesn’t have to be expensive to be valuable to you.
When a gift makes you happy or is something you
really need, you feel grateful for it.
2 Of all the gifts that God has given us, there is
one gift that we need more than anything else. It is
God’s greatest gift to humans. In this chapter, we
will learn that Jehovah sent his Son, Jesus Christ, so
that we can live forever. (Read Matthew 20:28.) By
sending Jesus to the earth as a ransom, Jehovah has
proved that he really loves us.
WHAT IS THE RANSOM?
3

The ransom is Jehovah’s way of freeing humans
from sin and death. (Ephesians 1:7) To understand
why the ransom was needed, we have to know what
happened thousands of years ago in the garden of
Eden. Our ?rst parents, Adam and Eve, sinned. Because they sinned, they died. We also die because
we inherited sin from Adam and Eve.—See Endnote 9.
4 When Jehovah created the ?rst man, Adam, He

53

gave him something very precious. He gave Adam
perfect human life. He had a perfect mind and a
perfect body. He would never get sick, would never
grow old, and would never die. Because Jehovah
created Adam, He was like a father to him. (Luke 3:
38) Jehovah regularly talked to him. God clearly explained to Adam what he expected from him and
gave him enjoyable work to do.—Genesis 1:28-30; 2:
16, 17.
5 Adam was created “in God’s image.” (Genesis 1:
27) Jehovah gave him qualities like His own, including love, wisdom, justice, and power. He gave Adam
free will. Adam was not a robot. God created him so
that he could choose to do right or wrong. If Adam
had chosen to obey God, he could have lived forever in Paradise.
6 When he disobeyed God and was sentenced to
death, Adam paid a very high price. He lost his special friendship with Jehovah, his perfect life, and
his Paradise home. (Genesis 3:17-19) Adam and
Eve chose to disobey God, so there was no hope
for them. Because of what Adam did, “sin entered
into the world and death through sin, and so death
spread to all men because they had all sinned.” (Romans 5:12) When Adam sinned, he “sold” himself
and us into slavery to sin and death. (Romans 7:14)
Is there any hope for us? Yes, there is.
5. What does it mean when the Bible says that Adam was made “in
God’s image”?
6. When Adam disobeyed God, what did he lose? How does this
a?ect us?

54

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?
7

What is a ransom? The idea of a ransom basically involves two things. First, a ransom is the price
paid to release someone or to buy something back.
Second, a ransom is the price that covers, or pays,
the cost of something.
8 No human could pay for the enormous damage
that Adam did when he sinned and brought death
upon us. But Jehovah provided the way to free us
from sin and death. Let us learn how the ransom
works and how we can bene?t from it.
HOW JEHOVAH PROVIDED THE RANSOM
9

None of us could ever pay the ransom for the
perfect life that Adam lost. Why not? Because all
of us are imperfect. (Psalm 49:7, 8) The ransom
that had to be paid was another perfect human life.
That is why it is called “a corresponding ransom.”
(1 Timothy 2:6) The ransom had to have the same
value as the life that Adam lost.
10 How did Jehovah provide the ransom? Jehovah
sent his most precious Son to the earth. This Son,
Jesus, was his very ?rst creation. (1 John 4:9, 10) Jesus was willing to leave his Father and his home in
heaven. (Philippians 2:7) Jehovah transferred Jesus
from heaven to earth, and Jesus was born as a perfect human, without sin.—Luke 1:35.

mans when he disobeyed Jehovah. Could another man remove death for all of Adam’s children?
Yes. (Read Romans 5:19.) Jesus, who never sinned,
gave his perfect life as the ransom. (1 Corinthians 15:45) His perfect life could be used to remove
death for all of Adam’s children.—1 Corinthians 15:
21, 22.
12 The Bible describes how much Jesus su?ered
before he died. He was cruelly whipped, nailed to a
torture stake, and made to endure a slow and painful death. (John 19:1, 16-18, 30) Why did Jesus have
to su?er so much? Because Satan claimed that no
human would be loyal to God if he was severely tested. Jesus proved that a perfect man can be loyal
to God even if he su?ers to the extreme. Imagine
how proud Jehovah was of Jesus!—Proverbs 27:11;
see Endnote 15.
13 How was the ransom paid? Jesus gave his Father the value of his life. In the year 33, on Nisan 14
of the Jewish calendar, Jehovah allowed Jesus’ enemies to kill him. (Hebrews 10:10) Three days after
that, Jehovah brought Jesus back to life, not as a human, but as a spirit person. Later, when Jesus returned to his Father in heaven, he presented the
value of his perfect human life to Jehovah as the
ransom. (Hebrews 9:24) Now that the ransom has
been paid, we have the opportunity to be set free
from sin and death.—Read Romans 3:23, 24.

56

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

HOW YOU CAN BENEFIT FROM
THE RANSOM
14

We already bene?t from God’s greatest gift. Let
us see how we bene?t now and how we will bene?t
in the future.
15 Our sins are forgiven. It is hard to do what is
right all the time. We make mistakes, and we sometimes say and do the wrong thing. (Colossians 1:13,
14) How can we be forgiven? We should be truly
sorry for what we have done wrong and humbly ask
Jehovah to forgive us. We can then have the con?dence that our sins are forgiven.—1 John 1:8, 9.
16 We can have a good conscience. If our conscience tells us that we have done something
wrong, we feel guilty, maybe even hopeless and
worthless. But there is no need to give up. If we beg
Jehovah for forgiveness, we can be sure that he will
listen to us and forgive us. (Hebrews 9:13, 14) Jehovah wants us to talk to him about any of our problems and weaknesses. (Hebrews 4:14-16) As a result,
we can be at peace with God.
17 We have the hope of living forever. “The wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 6:23)
Because Jesus died for us, we can live forever and
enjoy perfect health. (Revelation 21:3, 4) But what
must we do to receive those blessings?
14, 15. What must we do for our sins to be forgiven?
16. What must we do to have a good conscience?
17. What blessings are possible because Jesus died for us?

Jehovah gave
his precious Son
as a ransom for us

58

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

WILL YOU ACCEPT THE RANSOM?
18

Think of how your heart is touched when
someone gives you a beautiful gift. The ransom
is the most precious gift of all, and we should be
deeply grateful to Jehovah for it. John 3:16 tells us
that “God loved the world so much that he gave his
only-begotten Son.” Yes, Jehovah loves us so much
that he gave us his precious Son, Jesus. And we
know that Jesus also loves us, because he was willing to die for us. (John 15:13) The gift of the ransom should convince you that Jehovah and Jesus
really love you.—Galatians 2:20.
19 Now that you’ve learned about God’s great
love, how can you become his friend? It is not
easy to love someone you don’t know. John 17:3
says that we can come to know Jehovah. As you
do this, your love for him will deepen, you will
want to please him, and you will become his friend.
So keep learning about Jehovah by studying the Bible.—1 John 5:3.
20 Accept Jesus’ ransom sacrifice. The Bible says
that “the one who exercises faith in the Son has
everlasting life.” (John 3:36) What does it mean to
exercise faith? It means to do what Jesus taught us
to do. (John 13:15) We cannot simply say that we
believe in Jesus. To accept the ransom, we must do
something about our faith. At James 2:26, we read:
“Faith without works is dead.”
18. How do we know that Jehovah loves us?

you show that you accept Jesus’ ransom sacri?ce?

As we learn
about Jehovah,
we will become
his friend and
our love for him
will deepen

21

Attend the Memorial of Christ’s death. The
evening before Jesus died, he taught us that we
should have a memorial of his death. We do this
each year, and it is called the Memorial or “the
Lord’s Evening Meal.” (1 Corinthians 11:20; Matthew 26:26-28) Jesus wants us to remember that he
gave his perfect life as a ransom for us. He said:
“Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (Read
Luke 22:19.) When you attend the Memorial, you
show that you remember the ransom and the great
love that Jehovah and Jesus have for us.—See Endnote 16.
22 The ransom is the greatest gift we could ever
receive. (2 Corinthians 9:14, 15) That precious gift
will even bene?t millions of people who have already died. Chapters 6 and 7 will discuss how that is
possible.

CHAPTER SIX

WHERE DO WE GO WHEN WE DIE?
THE Bible promises us that one day “death will be no
more.” (Revelation 21:4) In Chapter 5, we learned
that the ransom makes it possible for us to have everlasting life. But people still die. (Ecclesiastes 9:5) So
one of the big questions we ask is, What happens to
us when we die?
2 The answer to that question is especially important when someone we love dies. We may wonder:
‘Where has he gone? Is he watching us? Can he help
us? Will we ever see him again?’
3 Religions answer those questions in di?erent
ways. Some teach that if you are a good person, you
go to heaven and that if you are a bad person, you
burn in hell. Some say that when you die you become a spirit and live with your family members
who have already died. And others say that after you
have died and are judged, you will be reborn, or
come back to life with a di?erent body, perhaps as
another person or even an animal.
4 Religions seem to teach very di?erent things. But
almost all of them teach one basic idea. They teach
that when a human dies, a part of him keeps on living. Is that true?

religions answer them?
4. What basic idea do religions teach about death?

WHERE DO WE GO WHEN WE DIE?

63

WHERE DO WE GO WHEN WE DIE?
5

Jehovah knows what happens to us when we die,
and he has told us that when a person dies, his life
ends. Death is the opposite of life. So when someone
dies, his feelings and memories do not keep on living somewhere else.1 When we die we can’t see, we
can’t hear, and we can’t think anymore.
6 King Solomon wrote that “the dead know nothing at all.” The dead cannot love or hate, and “there
is no work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom
in the Grave.” (Read Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6, 10.) And at
Psalm 146:4, the Bible tells us that when someone
dies, “his thoughts” die.
WHAT JESUS SAID ABOUT DEATH
7

When his good friend Lazarus died, Jesus said to
his disciples: “Lazarus our friend has fallen asleep.”
But Jesus didn’t mean that Lazarus was resting. Jesus
further said: “Lazarus has died.” (John 11:11-14) So
Jesus compared death to sleep. He didn’t say that
Lazarus was in heaven or with his family members who had died. And he didn’t say that Lazarus
was su?ering in hell or being reborn as another human or an animal. No, it was as if Lazarus were in a
deep sleep. Other scriptures compare death to a deep
sleep. The Bible says that when Stephen was killed,
“he fell asleep in death.” (Acts 7:60) The apostle Paul
1 Some people believe that a soul or spirit keeps living after
someone dies. For more information, see Endnotes 17 and 18.

also wrote that some Christians had “fallen asleep in
death.”—1 Corinthians 15:6.
8 Did God create Adam and Eve so that they would
eventually die? No! Jehovah created them to enjoy
life forever with perfect health. When Jehovah made
humans, he gave them the desire to live forever. (Ecclesiastes 3:11) Parents do not want to see their children grow old and die, and Jehovah feels the same
way about us. But if God created us to live forever,
why do we die?

WHY DO WE DIE?
9

In the garden of Eden, Jehovah told Adam:
“From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction. But as for the tree of the knowledge of good
and bad, you must not eat from it, for in the day you
eat from it you will certainly die.” (Genesis 2:9, 16,
17) That clear command was not di?cult to obey,
and Jehovah had the right to tell Adam and Eve what
is good and what is bad. By obeying Jehovah, they
would show him that they respected his authority.
They would also show him just how thankful they
were for everything he had given them.
10 Sadly, Adam and Eve chose to disobey Jehovah.
Satan said to Eve: “Did God really say that you must
not eat from every tree of the garden?” Eve replied:
“We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden.
But God has said about the fruit of the tree that is in
the middle of the garden: ‘You must not eat from it,
no, you must not touch it; otherwise you will die.’ ”
—Genesis 3:1-3.
11 Then Satan said: “You certainly will not die. For
God knows that in the very day you eat from it, your
eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and bad.” (Genesis 3:4-6) Satan wanted Eve
to think that she could decide for herself what was
good and what was bad. At the same time, he lied

66

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

about what would happen if she disobeyed. Satan
said that Eve wouldn’t die, so Eve ate some of the
fruit and then gave some to her husband. Adam and
Eve knew that Jehovah had told them not to eat the
fruit. When they ate it, they chose to disobey a clear
and reasonable command. By eating, they showed
that they did not respect their loving heavenly Father. There is no excuse for what they did!
12 How disappointing that our ?rst parents had
such disrespect for their Creator! How would you
feel if you worked hard to raise a son and a daughter
and then they rebelled against you and did the opposite of what you asked them to do? Wouldn’t it break
your heart?
13 When they disobeyed, Adam and Eve lost the
opportunity to live forever. Jehovah had told Adam:
“For dust you are and
to dust you will reAdam came from the dust,
turn.” (Read Genesis
and he returned to the dust
3:19.) That meant that
Adam would become
dust again, as if he
had never been created. (Genesis 2:7) After
Adam sinned, he died
and no longer existed.
12. Why is it so disappointing that Adam and Eve disobeyed Jehovah?
13. What did Jehovah mean
when he said “to dust you
will return”?

WHERE DO WE GO WHEN WE DIE?

67

14

If Adam and Eve had obeyed God, they would
still be alive today. But when they disobeyed him,
they sinned, and eventually they died. Sin is like a
terrible disease that we have inherited from our ?rst
parents. All of us are born as sinners, and that is why
we die. (Romans 5:12) But that is not God’s purpose for humans. God never wanted humans to die,
and the Bible calls death an “enemy.”—1 Corinthians
15:26.
THE TRUTH SETS US FREE
The truth about death sets us free from many
wrong ideas. The Bible teaches us that the dead don’t
feel pain or sadness. We can’t speak to them, and they
can’t speak to us. We can’t help the dead, and the
dead can’t help us. They can’t harm us, so we don’t
need to be afraid of them. However, many religions
tell us that the dead are alive somewhere and that we
can help them if we pay money to priests or those
viewed as holy men. But when we know the truth
about death, we are not fooled by those lies.
15

16

Satan uses false religion to lie to us and make us
think that the dead are still alive. For example, some
religions teach that when we die, a part of us keeps
on living somewhere else. Does your religion teach
you that, or does it teach you what the Bible says
about the dead? Satan uses lies to turn people away
from Jehovah.
14. Why do we die?
15. How does the truth about death set us free?
16. What lie do many religions teach about the dead?

68

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?
17

What many religions teach is shocking. For example, some teach that bad people will burn forever
in hell. That lie is an insult to Jehovah. He would
never allow people to su?er that way! (Read 1 John
4:8.) How would you feel about someone who punishes a child by burning the child’s hands in a ?re?
You would think he is very cruel. You would not
want to get to know him. And that is exactly how Satan wants us to feel about Jehovah!
18 Some religions tell us that when people die,
they become spirits. Such religions teach that we
must respect and even be afraid of those spirits because they can become either powerful friends or terrible enemies. Many people believe that lie. They
fear the dead, so they worship them instead of Jehovah. Remember that the dead cannot feel or sense
anything, so we don’t have to be afraid of them. Jehovah is our Creator. He is the true God, and we
should worship only him.—Revelation 4:11.
19 When we know the truth about death, we are set
free from religious lies. And this truth helps us to understand the wonderful promises that Jehovah has
made about our life and our future.
20 A long time ago, a servant of God named Job
asked: “If a man dies, can he live again?” (Job 14:14)
Is it really possible for a person who is dead to live
again? The answer God gives us in the Bible is very
exciting. We will see it in the next chapter.

IMAGINE that you have been sentenced to life in
prison for a crime you didn’t commit. There is
no chance of your ever being released. Your future

about it. But just when you’ve lost all hope, you ?nd

3 Imagine the relief you will feel when you don’t
have to worry about dying! But Jehovah will not only
remove death. He will also bring those who have already died back to life. Think what that will mean for
you. He promises that those “powerless in death”
will live again. (Isaiah 26:19) This is what the Bible
calls the resurrection.

to life. But the Bible gives us real comfort. (Read
2 Corinthians 1:3, 4.) Let us consider one example
that shows how much Jehovah and Jesus want to
bring our loved ones back to life. When Jesus was on
earth, he often visited Lazarus and his sisters, Martha
and Mary. All three were good friends of Jesus. The
Bible says: “Jesus loved Martha and her sister and
Lazarus.” Then one day Lazarus died.—John 11:3-5.
5 Jesus went to comfort Martha and Mary. When
Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went outside the city to meet him. She was happy to see Jesus,
but she said to him: “If you had been here, my brother would not have died.” Martha thought that Jesus
was too late. After that, Jesus saw her sister, Mary,
crying. Seeing their sadness, he felt hurt and cried.
(John 11:21, 33, 35) He felt the deep pain that comes
when we lose someone we love.
6 Knowing that Jesus feels the way we do about
death is a comfort to us. And Jesus is just like his Father. (John 14:9) Jehovah has the power to remove
death forever, and that is what he will do very soon.
“LAZARUS, COME OUT!”

with a large stone. Jesus said: “Take the stone away.”
But Martha didn’t want them to. Lazarus’ body had
already been in the tomb for four days. (John 11:39)
She did not know what Jesus was about to do to help
her brother.
8 Jesus said to Lazarus: “Come out!” What Martha
and Mary saw next was amazing. “The man who had
been dead came out with his feet and hands bound
with wrappings.” (John 11:43, 44) Lazarus had been
brought back to life! He was reunited with his family and friends. They could hold him, touch him, and
talk to him. What a miracle! Jesus had resurrected
Lazarus.
“LITTLE GIRL, I SAY TO YOU, ‘GET UP!’ ”
9

Did Jesus resurrect people by his own power? No.
Before he resurrected Lazarus, Jesus prayed to Jehovah, and Jehovah gave him the power to resurrect
Lazarus. (Read John 11:41, 42.) Lazarus wasn’t the
only person who was resurrected. The Bible tells us
about a 12-year-old girl who was very sick. Her father, Jairus, was desperate, and he begged Jesus to
heal her. She was his only child. While he was talking
to Jesus, some men came up and said: “Your daughter died! Why bother the Teacher any longer?” But
Jesus said to Jairus: “Have no fear, only have faith,
and she will be saved.” He then walked to Jairus’
home with him. As they came near the house, Jesus
could see and hear people crying. Jesus told them:
9, 10. (a) Who gave Jesus the power to resurrect people? (b) Why
are the resurrection accounts valuable to us?

74

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

“Stop weeping, for she did not die but is sleeping.”
Her father and mother must have wondered what Jesus meant. Jesus asked everyone to leave and took
her father and mother into the room where their little girl was lying. Jesus gently took her by the hand
and said to her: “Little girl, I say to you, ‘Get up!’ ”
Imagine the joy of her parents when she immediately got up and started walking! Jesus had resurrected
their daughter. (Mark 5:22-24, 35-42; Luke 8:49-56)
From that day on, when they saw their little girl, they
would remember what Jehovah had done for them
through Jesus.1
10 Those whom Jesus brought back to life died
again later. But what we read about these people is
valuable because it gives us real hope. Jehovah wants
to resurrect people, and he will.
WHAT WE LEARN FROM
THE RESURRECTION ACCOUNTS
11

The Bible clearly says that “the dead know nothing at all.” That was true of Lazarus. (Ecclesiastes 9:5)
Just as Jesus said, it was as if Lazarus had been sleeping. (John 11:11) While he was in the grave, Lazarus
knew “nothing at all.”
12 When Jesus resurrected Lazarus, many people
1 In other accounts, the Bible tells us about the resurrections of
young and old, male and female, and Israelite and foreigner. You
can read them at 1 Kings 17:17-24; 2 Kings 4:32-37; 13:20, 21; Matthew 28:5-7; Luke 7:11-17; 8:40-56; Acts 9:36-42; 20:7-12.

saw it. Even Jesus’ enemies knew that he had performed this miracle. Lazarus was alive, and this
proved that the resurrection really happened. (John
11:47) Also, many people went to visit Lazarus, and
as a result, they started to believe that Jesus had been
sent by God. Jesus’ enemies didn’t like that, so they
planned to kill both Jesus and Lazarus.—John 11:53;
12:9-11.
13 Jesus said that “all those in the memorial
tombs” will be resurrected. (John 5:28) This means
that all those whom Jehovah remembers will come
back to life. But for Jehovah to resurrect someone, he
has to remember everything about that person. Can
he really do that? Well, there are billions of stars in
the universe. The Bible says that Jehovah knows the
name of every single star. (Read Isaiah 40:26.) If he
can remember the name of each star, then surely
he can easily remember everything about all those
he will bring back to life. More important, Jehovah
created everything, so we know that he has the power to bring people back to life.
14 The faithful man Job believed in the resurrection. He asked: “If a man dies, can he live again?”
Then he said to Jehovah: “You will call, and I
will answer you. You will long for the work of your
hands.” Yes, Job knew that Jehovah is looking forward to the time when he will resurrect the dead.
—Job 14:13-15.
13. Why can we be sure that Jehovah will resurrect the dead?
14, 15. What do Job’s words teach us about the resurrection?

77

15

How does the hope of the resurrection make
you feel? You may be wondering, ‘What about my
family and friends who have died, will they be resurrected too?’ It comforts us to know that Jehovah really wants to bring the dead back to life. Let us see what
the Bible says about where they will live and who
will be resurrected.
THEY “WILL HEAR HIS VOICE
AND COME OUT”
16

In the past, those who were resurrected were reunited with their family and friends here on earth.
This will also happen in the future, but it will be
much better. Why? Because those who are brought
back to life on earth will have the opportunity to live
forever and never die again. And they will live in a
world very di?erent from the one we live in today.
There will be no war, no crime, and no sickness.
17 Who will be resurrected? Jesus said that “all
those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice
and come out.” (John 5:28, 29) And Revelation 20:
13 tells us: “The sea gave up the dead in it, and
death and the Grave gave up the dead in them.” Yes,
billions of people will live again. The apostle Paul
also said that both “the righteous and the unrighteous” will be resurrected. (Read Acts 24:15.) What
does that mean?

19

“The unrighteous” include billions of people
who did not have the opportunity to know Jehovah. Even though they died, Jehovah hasn’t forgotten them. He will resurrect them, and they will have
the opportunity to learn about him and serve him.
20 Does this mean that everyone who has died
will be resurrected? No. Jesus said that some people
would not be brought back to life. (Luke 12:5) Who
will decide whether a person will be resurrected or
not? Jehovah is the ?nal Judge, but he has also given
Jesus the authority “to be judge of the living and the
dead.” (Acts 10:42) Anyone who is judged as wicked
and unwilling to change will not be resurrected.—See
Endnote 19.
RESURRECTION TO HEAVEN
21

The Bible also tells us that some people will live
in heaven. When someone is resurrected to heaven,
he is not brought back to life as a human with a human body. He is resurrected to life in heaven as a
spirit person.
22 Jesus was the ?rst person to receive this type of
resurrection. (John 3:13) Three days after Jesus was
killed, Jehovah resurrected him. (Psalm 16:10; Acts
13:34, 35) Jesus was not resurrected with a human
body. The apostle Peter explains that Jesus “was put
to death in the ?esh but made alive in the spirit.”

them?

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

(1 Peter 3:18) Jesus was brought back to life as a powerful spirit person! (1 Corinthians 15:3-6) But the Bible says that he would not be the only one.
23 Just before he died, Jesus told his faithful disciples: “I am going my way to prepare a place for you.”
(John 14:2) This means that some of his followers
would be resurrected to live with him in heaven.
How many? Jesus said that it would be a small number, a “little ?ock.” (Luke 12:32) The apostle John
gave the exact number when he saw Jesus “standing
on [heavenly] Mount Zion, and with him 144,000.”
—Revelation 14:1.
24 When would the 144,000 Christians be resurrected? The Bible tells us that this would happen after Christ started to rule in heaven. (1 Corinthians
15:23) We are living in that time right now, and most
of the 144,000 have already been resurrected to heaven. Those who are still on earth and who die in our
day will instantly be resurrected to life in heaven.
However, the majority of people will be resurrected
in the future to life in Paradise here on earth.
25 Very soon, Jehovah will free all humans from
death, and death will be gone forever! (Read Isaiah 25:8.) But what will those who go to heaven do
there? The Bible explains that they will rule with Jesus in a Kingdom government. We will learn more
about that government in the next chapter.

CHAPTER EIGHT

WHAT IS GOD’S KINGDOM?
MILLIONS of people know the famous prayer called
the Our Father, or the Lord’s Prayer. Jesus used this
prayer to teach his disciples how to pray. What did he
pray for? And why is this prayer important for us today?
2 Jesus said: “You must pray, then, this way: ‘Our
Father in the heavens, let your name be sancti?ed
[or, be made holy]. Let your Kingdom come. Let your
will take place, as in heaven, also on earth.’ ” (Read
Matthew 6:9-13.) Why did Jesus teach us to pray for
those three things?—See Endnote 20.
3 We have learned that God’s name is Jehovah.
And we have discussed what God’s will is for humans
and for the earth. But what did Jesus mean when he
said: “Let your Kingdom come”? We will learn what
God’s Kingdom is, what it will do, and how it will
make God’s name holy.

Jehovah set up a heavenly government and
chose Jesus to be its King. The Bible calls this government God’s Kingdom. Jesus is “the King of those

lords.” (1 Timothy 6:15) Jesus is able to do more good
than any human ruler ever could, and he is more
powerful than all human rulers put together.
5 Forty days after his resurrection, Jesus returned
to heaven. Eventually, Jehovah appointed him as
King of the Kingdom. (Acts 2:33) God’s government
will rule over the earth from heaven. (Revelation
11:15) That’s why the Bible calls God’s Kingdom a
“heavenly Kingdom.”—2 Timothy 4:18.
6 The Bible says that Jesus is greater than any human king because he is “the one alone having immortality.” (1 Timothy 6:16) All human rulers eventually die, but Jesus will never die. All the good that
Jesus will do for us will last forever.
7 Bible prophecy says that Jesus will be a fair and
compassionate King: “The spirit of Jehovah will settle upon him, the spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the spirit of counsel and of mightiness,
the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah.
And he will ?nd delight in the fear of Jehovah. He
will not judge by what appears to his eyes, nor reprove [or, counsel] simply according to what his ears
hear. He will judge the lowly [or, poor] with fairness.” (Isaiah 11:2-4) Would you want your king to
be like that?

tle Paul told Timothy: “If we go on enduring, we will
also rule together as kings.” (2 Timothy 2:12) How
many will rule as kings with Jesus?
9 As we learned in Chapter 7, the apostle John
was given a vision where he saw Jesus as King in
heaven with 144,000 other kings. Who are the 144,000? John explains that they “have [Jesus’] name
and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.” And he adds: “These are the ones who keep
following the Lamb [that is, Jesus] no matter where
he goes. These were bought from among mankind.”
(Read Revelation 14:1, 4.) The 144,000 are faithful
Christians whom God has chosen “to rule as kings
over the earth” with Jesus. When they die, they are
resurrected to life in heaven. (Revelation 5:10) Since
the time of the apostles, Jehovah has been choosing
faithful Christians to be part of that group of 144,000
kings.
10 Jehovah cares for us so much that he has arranged for humans to rule with Jesus. Jesus will be
a good ruler because he understands us. He knows
what it’s like to be a human and to su?er. Paul
said that Jesus feels for us, he can “sympathize with
our weaknesses,” and he “has been tested in all respects as we have.” (Hebrews 4:15; 5:8) The 144,000
also know what it’s like to be human. And they have
struggled with imperfection and sickness. So we can

be sure that Jesus and the 144,000 will understand
not only how we feel but also the problems we have
to deal with.
WHAT WILL GOD’S
KINGDOM DO?
11

Jesus taught his disciples to pray for God’s will
to take place in heaven. Why? We learned in Chapter 3 that Satan the Devil rebelled against Jehovah.
After Satan rebelled, Jehovah allowed him and the
unfaithful angels, or demons, to stay in heaven for a
time. So not all in heaven were doing God’s will. In
Chapter 10, we will learn more about Satan and the
demons.
12 The Bible explains that soon after Jesus was
made King of God’s Kingdom, he would go to war
against Satan. (Read Revelation 12:7-10.) Verse 10
describes two very important events. God’s Kingdom
begins to rule with Jesus Christ as King, and Satan is
thrown out of heaven down to the earth. As we will
learn, these events have already happened.
13 The Bible describes the joy of the faithful angels
after Satan and his demons were thrown out of heaven. We read: “Be glad, you heavens and you who reside in them!” (Revelation 12:12) There is now total
peace and unity in heaven because everyone there is
doing God’s will.

14

But life on earth is very di?erent. Terrible things
happen to people “because the Devil has come
down” and he has “great anger, knowing that he has
a short period of time.” (Revelation 12:12) Satan is
furious. He has been thrown out of heaven, and he
knows he will be destroyed very soon. He does everything he can to cause trouble, pain, and su?ering all
over the earth.
15 But God’s will for the earth has not changed. He
still wants perfect humans to live forever on a paradise earth. (Psalm 37:29) So how will God’s Kingdom
make this possible?
16 The prophecy at Daniel 2:44 says: “In the days
of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed. And this kingdom
will not be passed on to any other people. It will
crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it
alone will stand forever.” What does this prophecy
teach us about God’s Kingdom?
17 First, it tells us that God’s Kingdom would begin ruling “in the days of those kings.” This means
that other governments would still exist on the earth
when the Kingdom started to rule. Second, it tells us
that God’s Kingdom would last forever and never be
replaced by another government. And third, there
would be war between God’s Kingdom and the governments of this world. God’s Kingdom would win

and become the only government ruling over the
earth. Then humans will have the best government
they could ever have.
18 How will God’s Kingdom take over the rulership
of the earth? Before the ?nal war, called the war of
Armageddon, the demons will mislead “the kings of
the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together
to the war of the great day of God the Almighty.” Yes,
human governments will ?ght against God’s Kingdom.—Revelation 16:14, 16; see Endnote 10.
19 Why do we need God’s Kingdom? There are at
least three reasons. First, we are sinners, so we get sick
and die. But the Bible says that under God’s Kingdom, we will live forever. In fact, John 3:16 says:
“God loved the world so much that he gave his onlybegotten Son, so that everyone exercising faith in
him might not be destroyed but have everlasting
life.”
20 A second reason why we need God’s Kingdom
is that we are surrounded by wicked people. Many
lie and cheat and are immoral. We can’t do anything to remove them, but God will. People who
keep doing wicked things will be destroyed during
Armageddon. (Read Psalm 37:10.) A third reason why
we need God’s Kingdom is that human governments
have been weak, cruel, or corrupt. They are not interested in helping people to obey God. The Bible says

that “man has dominated man to his harm.”—Ecclesiastes 8:9.
21 After Armageddon, God’s Kingdom will make
sure that God’s will is done on earth. For example, it
will remove Satan and his demons. (Revelation 20:
1-3) Eventually, nobody will get sick or die. Because
of the ransom, all faithful humans will be able to live
forever in Paradise. (Revelation 22:1-3) The Kingdom
will sanctify God’s name. What does this mean? It
means that when God’s government rules the earth,
all humans will honor Jehovah’s name.—See Endnote 21.

King. Was Jesus made King as soon as he returned to
heaven? No, he would have to wait. Some time after
Jesus’ resurrection, both Peter and Paul made this
clear when they applied the prophecy at Psalm 110:1
to Jesus. In the prophecy Jehovah says: “Sit at my
right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for
your feet.” (Acts 2:32-35; Hebrews 10:12, 13) How
long would Jesus need to wait before Jehovah would
make him King?
23 For many years before 1914, a group of sincere
Christians understood that it would be an important
year in Bible prophecy. World events since 1914 have
proved that they were correct. Jesus began to rule as
King in that year. (Psalm 110:2) Soon after that, Satan was thrown down to the earth, and now “he has
a short period of time.” (Revelation 12:12) In the
next chapter, we will see more evidence that we are
living in that time period. We will also learn that
very soon God’s Kingdom will make sure that God’s
will is done on earth.—See Endnote 22.

CHAPTER NINE

IS THE END OF THE WORLD NEAR?
HAVE you ever watched the news and thought, ‘Can
things get any worse?’ There is so much tragedy and
cruelty that some people believe we must be close to
the end of the world. Is that true? Is there a way to
know what will happen in the future? Yes. Although
humans cannot predict what will happen, Jehovah
God can. He tells us in the Bible about our future and
the earth’s future.—Isaiah 46:10; James 4:14.
2 When we read in the Bible about the end of the
world, it means, not the end of planet Earth, but the
end of wickedness. Jesus taught people that the Kingdom of God would rule over the earth. (Luke 4:43)
His disciples wanted to know when God’s Kingdom
would come, and they asked Jesus: “When will these
things be, and what will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?”
(Matthew 24:3) Jesus did not give them the exact
date, but he told them what would happen just before the end of this world. What Jesus said would
happen is happening right now.
3 In this chapter we will discuss evidence that we

place in heaven so that we can understand why
things are so bad here on earth.
A WAR IN HEAVEN
4

In Chapter 8 we learned that Jesus became King
in heaven in 1914. (Daniel 7:13, 14) The book of Revelation tells us what happened: “War broke out in
heaven: Michael [meaning, Jesus] and his angels battled with the dragon [Satan], and the dragon and its
angels battled.”1 Satan and his demons lost the war
and were thrown down to the earth. Imagine the joy
that the angels felt! But what about the people on
earth? The Bible says that it would be a time of trouble for mankind. Why? Because the Devil is very angry, “knowing that he has a short period of time.”
—Revelation 12:7, 9, 12.
5 The Devil is causing as much trouble as he can
on earth. He’s furious because he has a short time
left before God removes him. Let us examine what
Jesus said would happen during the last days.—See
Endnote 24.
THE LAST DAYS
War. Jesus said: “Nation will rise against nation
and kingdom against kingdom.” (Matthew 24:7)

96

More people have been killed
in wars in our time than at any
other time in history. One report from the Worldwatch Institute shows that since 1914,
wars have killed more than
100 million people. More than
three times as many people
were killed in wars during the
100 years between 1900 and
2000 as were killed during
the previous 1,900 years. Just
imagine the misery and pain
that millions of people have
felt because of war!
7 Hunger. Jesus said: “There
will be food shortages.” (Matthew 24:7) Even though more
food is produced now than
ever before, many people never
have enough to eat. Why? Because they don’t have enough
money to buy food or land on
which to grow it. More than
a billion people have less than
one dollar a day to live on. The
World Health Organization
says that millions of children
die each year, mainly because
they don’t have enough food
to keep them healthy.

97
8

Earthquakes. Jesus prophesied: “There will be great
earthquakes.” (Luke 21:11)
Many powerful earthquakes
are now expected every year.
Since the year 1900, over
two million people have
died because of earthquakes.
And although technology has
helped to detect earthquakes
earlier than before, many people still die.
9 Disease. Jesus foretold that
there would be “pestilences.”
Dangerous diseases would
spread quickly and kill many.
(Luke 21:11) Even though doctors have learned how to treat
many sicknesses, there are
still sicknesses that cannot be
cured. In fact, one report explains that each year, millions
of people die from diseases,
such as tuberculosis, malaria,
and cholera. Not only that, but
doctors have found 30 new diseases, and some of them have
no cure.
8, 9. What shows that Jesus’ prophecies about earthquakes and disease
have come true?

98

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

WHAT PEOPLE WOULD BE LIKE IN THE LAST DAYS
10

At 2 Timothy 3:1-5, the Bible says: “In the last
days critical times hard to deal with will be here.”
The apostle Paul described how many people would
behave during the last days. He said people would

11

Do many people behave like this where you
live? All over the world,
many do. But God will
soon do something about
it. He promises: “When

they may be annihilated [or, destroyed] forever.”
—Psalm 92:7.
GOOD NEWS IN THE LAST DAYS
12

The Bible foretold that during the last days, the
world would be full of pain and su?ering. But the Bible also says that good things will happen.
13 Understanding the Bible. The prophet Daniel
wrote about the last days. He said: “The true knowledge will become abundant.” (Daniel 12:4) God
would give his people the ability to understand the
Bible more clearly than ever before. Jehovah has
done this especially since 1914. For example, he has
taught us the importance of his name and his purpose for the earth as well as the truth about the ransom, what happens when we die, and the resurrection. We have learned that only God’s Kingdom can
solve all our problems. We have also learned how to
be happy and how to live in a way that pleases God.
But what do God’s servants do with what they’ve
learned? Another prophecy gives us the answer.—See
Endnotes 21 and 25.
14 The global preaching work. Speaking about
the last days, Jesus said: “This good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth.”
(Matthew 24:3, 14) The good news of the Kingdom is
being preached in over 230 lands and in more than
700 languages. Yes, all over the earth, Jehovah’s
Witnesses from “all nations and tribes” are helping

people to understand what the Kingdom is and what
it will do for mankind. (Revelation 7:9) And they do
this free of charge. Although they are hated and persecuted by many, nothing can stop the preaching
work, just as Jesus prophesied.—Luke 21:17.
WHAT WILL YOU DO?
Do you believe that we are living in the last
days? Many Bible prophecies about the last days are
coming true. Soon Jehovah will decide to stop the
preaching of the good news and “the end” will come.
(Matthew 24:14) What is the end? It is Armageddon,
when God will remove all wickedness. Jehovah will
use Jesus and his powerful angels to destroy anyone
who refuses to obey Him and his Son. (2 Thessalonians 1:6-9) After that, Satan and his demons will not
mislead people. And all those who want to obey God
and accept his Kingdom will see every promise of
God come true.—Revelation 20:1-3; 21:3-5.
15

16

This world ruled by Satan will soon come to its
end. So it is very important that we ask ourselves,
‘What do I need to do?’ Jehovah wants you to learn
as much as you can from the Bible. You need to take
your study seriously. (John 17:3) Jehovah’s Witnesses have meetings every week to help people understand the Bible. Try to attend those meetings regularly. (Read Hebrews 10:24, 25.) If you learn that you
need to make changes, don’t be afraid to make them.

As you make them, your friendship with Jehovah
will become stronger.—James 4:8.
17 The apostle Paul explained that the destruction
of the wicked will come when most people don’t expect it, “as a thief in the night.” (1 Thessalonians 5:2)
Jesus prophesied that many would choose to ignore
the evidence that we’re living in the last days. He
said: “Just as the days of Noah were, so the presence
of the Son of man [or, the last days] will be. For as
they were in those days before the Flood, eating and
drinking, men marrying and women being given in
marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the
ark, and they took no note until the Flood came and
swept them all away, so the presence of the Son of
man will be.”—Matthew 24:37-39.
18 Jesus warned that we should not become distracted “with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life.” He said that the end will come suddenly, “as a snare.” He also said that it “will come upon
all those dwelling on the face of the whole earth.”
Then he added: “Keep awake, then, all the time making supplication [or, praying very sincerely] that you
may succeed in escaping all these things that must
occur and in standing before the Son of man.” (Luke
21:34-36) Why is it so important to listen to Jesus’
warning? Because very soon Satan’s wicked world
will be destroyed. Only those who are approved by Jehovah and Jesus will survive the end and live forever
in the new world.—John 3:16; 2 Peter 3:13.

CHAPTER TEN

THE TRUTH ABOUT THE ANGELS
JEHOVAH wants us to know about his family. The angels are part of God’s family. In the Bible they are
called “sons of God.” (Job 38:7) What do the angels
do? How have they helped people in the past? And
can they help us now?—See Endnote 8.
2 We need to know where the angels came from.
Colossians 1:16 tells us that after Jehovah created Jesus, “all other things were created in the heavens and
on the earth.” That includes the angels. How many of
them were created? The Bible says that there are hundreds of millions of angels.—Psalm 103:20; Revelation 5:11.
3 The Bible also teaches us that Jehovah created the
angels before he created the earth. How did they feel
when they saw the earth? The book of Job tells us
that they were joyful. They were a close family serving Jehovah together.—Job 38:4-7.
ANGELS HELP GOD’S PEOPLE
Angels have always been interested in humans
and in Jehovah’s purpose for the earth and humans.
(Proverbs 8:30, 31; 1 Peter 1:11, 12) It must have made
them very sad when Adam and Eve rebelled. They

must be even sadder now to see that most humans
have disobeyed Jehovah. But when someone repents
and returns to God, the angels are joyful. (Luke 15:
10) The angels are very interested in those who serve
God. Jehovah uses angels to help and protect his servants on earth. (Hebrews 1:7, 14) Let us look at some
examples of this.
“My God sent his angel and
shut the mouth of the lions.”
—Daniel 6:22

THE TRUTH ABOUT THE ANGELS

107

5

Jehovah sent two angels to help Lot and his family escape the destruction of the cities of Sodom and
Gomorrah. (Genesis 19:15, 16) Hundreds of years later, the prophet Daniel was thrown into a lions’ pit,
but he was not harmed, because “God sent his angel and shut the mouth of the lions.” (Daniel 6:22)
Later, when the apostle Peter was in prison, Jehovah
sent an angel to set him free. (Acts 12:6-11) Angels
also helped Jesus when he was on earth. For example, after he was baptized, “angels were ministering to
him.” (Mark 1:13) Just before Jesus was executed, an
angel “strengthened him.”—Luke 22:43.
6 Today, angels no longer appear to humans. But
God still uses angels to help his servants. The Bible
says: “The angel of Jehovah camps all around those
fearing Him, and he rescues them.” (Psalm 34:7)
Why do we need protection? Because we have powerful enemies who want to harm us. Who are they?
Where do they come from? How are they trying to
harm us? To answer those questions, let’s see what
happened shortly after Adam and Eve were created.
OUR INVISIBLE ENEMIES
We learned in Chapter 3 that an angel rebelled
against God and wanted to rule over others. The Bible calls him Satan the Devil. (Revelation 12:9) Satan also wanted others to rebel against God. He was
able to trick Eve, and since then he has tricked most

humans. However, some, such as Abel, Enoch, and
Noah, remained faithful to Jehovah.—Hebrews 11:4,
5, 7.
8 In Noah’s time, some angels rebelled and left
their home in heaven to live as humans on earth.
Why? The Bible tells us that they wanted to have
wives. (Read Genesis 6:2.) But it was wrong for angels to do that. (Jude 6) Like those wicked angels,
most humans at that time became corrupt and violent. Jehovah then decided to destroy wicked humans
by ?ooding the whole earth. But he saved his faithful
servants. (Genesis 7:17, 23) To survive, the wicked angels returned to heaven. The Bible calls those wicked
angels demons. They chose to join Satan’s rebellion,
and the Devil became their ruler.—Matthew 9:34.
9 Because they were rebels, Jehovah did not accept
the demons back into his family. (2 Peter 2:4) Demons cannot change into humans anymore, but they
are still “misleading the entire inhabited earth.” (Revelation 12:9; 1 John 5:19) Let us learn how they are
able to trick, or mislead, so many.—Read 2 Corinthians 2:11.
HOW DEMONS TRICK PEOPLE
The demons trick people in many ways. When
people contact the demons they do it either directly
or through someone else, such as a witch doctor or a

psychic. Contact with the demons is called demonism or spiritism. But the Bible commands us to stay
far away from anything that has to do with the demons. (Galatians 5:19-21) Why? Just as a hunter uses
a trap to catch animals, the demons use tricks to trap
and control people.—See Endnote 26.
11 One of their tricks is called divination. That is
the use of supernatural powers to try to ?nd out
about the future or the unknown. Someone might
try to do this by looking at the stars, searching for
omens, reading tarot cards, using a crystal ball, or
reading the palm of a person’s hand. Many people
think that these practices are harmless, but they are
not. They are very dangerous. For example, the Bible
shows that demons and fortune-tellers work together.
At Acts 16:16-18, we read about “a demon of divination” who helped a girl to do “fortune-telling.” After
the apostle Paul sent the demon away, the girl lost
her ability to foretell the future.
12 The demons use another trick to trap people.
They try to make us believe that it’s possible to talk to
the dead and that those who have died are actually still alive somewhere and can communicate with
us or hurt us. For example, someone whose friend
or relative has died may go to a person, such as a
spirit medium, who says he or she can talk to the
dead. The medium may tell the person something
interesting about the dead friend or relative and even

imitate the dead person’s voice. (1 Samuel 28:3-19)
Many funeral customs are also based on the belief
that the dead are still alive somewhere. These may include funeral celebrations, funeral anniversaries, sacri?ces for the dead, widowhood rites, or some wake
rituals. When Christians refuse to take part in these
customs, their families or village communities may
criticize them, insult them, or refuse to have anything to do with them. But Christians know that the
dead are not alive somewhere else. It’s impossible to
communicate with them, and they cannot harm us.
(Psalm 115:17) Be very careful. Never try to communicate with the dead or the demons and never get
involved in demonic customs.—Read Deuteronomy
18:10, 11; Isaiah 8:19.
13 The demons not only trick people but also
frighten them. Today, Satan and his demons know
that they have only “a short period of time” before
God removes them from the earth, so they are more
violent and aggressive than ever. (Revelation 12:12,
17) However, thousands of people who once lived in
fear of the demons don’t fear them anymore. How
did they break free from their fear of the demons?
RESIST AND BREAK FREE FROM THE DEMONS
The Bible tells us how to resist the demons and
how to break free from them. For example, some in
the city of Ephesus were communicating with the

14. Like Christians in the ?rst century, how can we break free from

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

demons before they learned the truth. How did they
break free? The Bible says: “Quite a number of those
who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them up before everybody.” (Acts
19:19) Because they wanted to be Christians, they destroyed all their books about magic. Similar action is
necessary today. Everyone who wants to serve Jehovah needs to get rid of things that have anything to
do with the demons. This includes books, magazines,
horoscopes, movies, music, games, and even posters
that make magic, demons, or the supernatural seem
harmless or exciting. It also includes things that people wear to protect themselves from evil.—1 Corinthians 10:21.
15 Some years after those in Ephesus destroyed their
books about magic, the apostle Paul wrote that they
still had to “struggle” and ?ght “against the wicked
spirit forces.” (Ephesians 6:12) Yes, even though they
had already burned their books, the demons were still
trying to harm them. So, what else did they need to
do? Paul told them: “Take up the large shield of faith,
with which you will be able to extinguish [or, stop] all
the wicked one’s burning arrows.” (Ephesians 6:16)
Just as a shield protects a soldier in battle, our faith
can protect us. If we have absolute con?dence that Jehovah can protect us, we will be able to resist Satan
and the demons.—Matthew 17:20.
16 How can we make our faith in Jehovah stronger?
We need to read the Bible every day and learn to rely

on him to protect us. If we have strong con?dence in
Jehovah, Satan and the demons will not be able to
harm us.—1 John 5:5.
17 What else did the Christians in Ephesus need
to do? They lived in a city full of demonism. So
Paul told them: “Carry on prayer on every occasion.”
(Ephesians 6:18) They needed to ask Jehovah for his
protection at all times. What about us? We also live in
a world that is full of demonism. So we too need to
ask Jehovah for his protection, and we need to use his
name when we pray. (Read Proverbs 18:10.) If we
keep on asking Jehovah to deliver us from Satan, Jehovah will answer our prayers.—Psalm 145:19; Matthew 6:13.
18 If we get rid of everything in our life that has to
do with demonism and rely on Jehovah to protect us,
we can resist Satan and the demons. We do not need
to be afraid of them. (Read James 4:7, 8.) Jehovah is
far more powerful than the demons. He punished
them in Noah’s day, and in the future he will destroy them. (Jude 6) Remember, we are not alone in
our ?ght. Jehovah is using his angels to protect us.
(2 Kings 6:15-17) We can be con?dent that with Jehovah’s help, we can win our ?ght against Satan and the
demons.—1 Peter 5:6, 7; 2 Peter 2:9.
19 But if Satan and the demons are causing so
much su?ering, why hasn’t God destroyed them yet?
This question will be answered in the next chapter.

WHY SO MUCH
SUFFERING?
A TSUNAMI destroys a village. A gunman opens ?re
in a church, wounding and killing a number of people. Cancer takes a mother’s life, leaving behind ?ve
children.
2 When disasters or tragedies like those happen,
many people ask, “Why?” Many ask why the world is
so full of hatred and su?ering. Have you ever wondered about that yourself?
3 In the Bible, we learn that men who had deep
faith in God also asked such questions. For example, the prophet Habakkuk asked Jehovah: “Why do
you make me witness wrongdoing? And why do you
tolerate oppression? Why are destruction and violence before me? And why do quarreling and con?ict
abound?”—Habakkuk 1:3.
4 At Habakkuk 2:2, 3, we read God’s answer to Habakkuk’s questions and His promise to correct the
situation. Jehovah has deep love for people. The Bible says: “He cares for you.” (1 Peter 5:7) In fact, God
hates to see su?ering much more than we do. (Isaiah
55:8, 9) So then, let’s discuss the question, Why is
there so much su?ering in the world?

3, 4. (a) What questions did Habakkuk ask? (b) How did Jehovah
answer him?

WHY SO MUCH SUFFERING?

117

WHY IS THERE SO MUCH SUFFERING?
5

Pastors, priests, and religious teachers often say
that it is God’s will that people su?er. Some may say
that everything that happens to a person, including
tragedies, has already been decided by God and that
we can never understand why. Others may even say
that people, including little children, die so that they
can be with God in heaven. But that isn’t true. Jehovah never causes bad things to happen. The Bible
says: “It is unthinkable for the true God to act wickedly, for the Almighty to do wrong!”—Job 34:10.
6 Many people blame God for all the su?ering in
the world because they think that God rules the
world. But as we learned in Chapter 3, the real ruler
of the world is Satan the Devil.
7 The Bible tells us that “the whole world is lying
in the power of the wicked one.” (1 John 5:19) The
ruler of this world, Satan, is vicious and cruel. He is
“misleading the entire inhabited earth.” (Revelation
12:9) Many people imitate him. And that’s just one
reason why the world is so full of lies, hatred, and
cruelty.
8 There are other reasons why there is so much suffering in the world. After Adam and Eve rebelled,
they passed sin on to their children. And because
of sin, humans cause other humans to su?er. They

often want to be more important than others. They
?ght, they go to war, and they bully others. (Ecclesiastes 4:1; 8:9) Sometimes people su?er because
of “time and unexpected events.” (Ecclesiastes 9:11)
When they are in the wrong place at the wrong time,
accidents and other bad things can happen to them.
9 Jehovah never causes su?ering. He’s not to
blame for war, crime, and mistreatment. God does
not cause disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes,
and ?oods. But you may wonder, ‘If Jehovah is the
most powerful person in the universe, why doesn’t
he stop those terrible things from happening?’ We
know that God cares deeply about us, so he must
have a very good reason for allowing su?ering to
continue.—1 John 4:8.
WHY GOD ALLOWS SUFFERING
10

In the garden of Eden, the Devil misled Adam
and Eve. Satan accused God of being a bad Ruler. He
claimed that God was keeping something good from
Adam and Eve. Satan wanted them to believe that he
would be a better ruler than Jehovah and that they
did not need God.—Genesis 3:2-5; see Endnote 27.
11 Adam and Eve disobeyed Jehovah and rebelled
against him. They thought that they had the right
to decide for themselves what was right and what
was wrong. How could Jehovah prove that the rebels
were wrong and that he knows what is best for us?

10. How did Satan challenge Jehovah?
11. What question do we need to answer?

WHY SO MUCH SUFFERING?

119

12

Jehovah didn’t destroy Adam and Eve immediately. Instead, he allowed them to have children.
Then Jehovah made it possible for the children of
Adam and Eve to choose whom they wanted as their
ruler. Jehovah’s purpose was to ?ll the earth with
perfect people, and that was going to happen no
matter what the Devil tried to do.—Genesis 1:28; Isaiah 55:10, 11.
13 Satan challenged Jehovah in front of millions of
angels. (Job 38:7; Daniel 7:10) So Jehovah gave Satan
time to prove whether his accusation was true. He
also gave humans time to set up their own governments under Satan’s guidance to show whether they
could be successful without God’s help.
14 For thousands of years, humans have tried to
rule themselves, but they have failed. Satan has been
proved a liar. Humans do need God’s help. The
prophet Jeremiah was right when he said: “I well
know, O Jehovah, that man’s way does not belong to
him. It does not belong to man who is walking even
to direct his step.”—Jeremiah 10:23.

from happening? It has taken time to prove that

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

Satan’s rule has failed. Humans have tried every
kind of government, without success. Even though
they have made advances in science and technology,
there is more injustice, poverty, crime, and war than
ever before. We cannot successfully rule ourselves
without God.
16 However, Jehovah has not ?xed the problems
caused by Satan. If he did, it would mean God supports Satan’s rulership, and He will never do that.
Also, humans would believe that they are able to rule
themselves successfully. But that is a lie, and Jehovah
would not support that either. He never lies.—Hebrews 6:18.
17 Can Jehovah repair all the damage that has been
caused by the rebellion of Satan and humans? Yes.
With God, all things are possible. Jehovah knows
when all of Satan’s challenges will have been fully
answered. Then he will make the earth into a paradise, as it was meant to be. All those in “the memorial tombs” will be resurrected. (John 5:28, 29) People will never get sick or die. Jesus will undo all the
damage that Satan has caused. Jehovah will use Jesus
“to break up the works of the Devil.” (1 John 3:8)
We are grateful that in the meantime Jehovah has
been patient with us so that we can come to know
him and can decide that we want him to be our Ruler. (Read 2 Peter 3:9, 10.) Even when we su?er, he
helps us to endure.—John 4:23; read 1 Corinthians
10:13.
17, 18. What will Jehovah do about all the damage that Satan has
caused?

WHY SO MUCH SUFFERING?

Jehovah does not force us to choose him as our
Ruler. He gave humans the gift of free will. Let us examine what this precious gift means to us.
HOW WILL YOU USE THE GIFT OF FREE WILL?
19

Jehovah’s wonderful gift of free will makes us
very di?erent from the animals. They mainly act because of their instincts, but we can choose how we
want to live our lives and decide whether we want to
please Jehovah. (Proverbs 30:24) Also, we are not like
machines that do only what they are made to do. We
have the freedom to make choices about whom we
want to be, whom we want as our friends, and what
we want to do with our life. Jehovah wants us to enjoy life.
20 Jehovah wants us to love him. (Matthew 22:37,
38) He is like a father who is happy to hear his child
say “I love you” when the child says it from his heart
and not because he’s forced to. Jehovah gave us the
freedom to choose whether to serve him or not. Satan, Adam, and Eve chose to reject Jehovah. How will
you use your gift of free will?
21 Use your free will to serve Jehovah. There are
millions of others who have decided to please God
and to reject Satan. (Proverbs 27:11) What can you do
now so that you will be there in God’s new world
when he removes all su?ering? The next chapter will
answer that question.

grateful for this gift?

CHAPTER TWELVE

HOW CAN YOU BECOME
GOD’S FRIEND?
WHOM do you want as your friend? Someone whom
you like. Someone whom you get along with and
who gets along with you. Someone who has a kind
personality and qualities you admire.
2 Jehovah God selects some humans to be his
friends. For example, Abraham was one of Jehovah’s
friends. (Isaiah 41:8; James 2:23) Jehovah also liked
David. He said that David was ‘a man agreeable to his
heart.’ (Acts 13:22) And the prophet Daniel was “very
precious” to Jehovah.—Daniel 9:23.
3 How did Abraham, David, and Daniel become Jehovah’s friends? Jehovah said to Abraham: “You have
listened to my voice.” (Genesis 22:18) Jehovah becomes a friend of those who humbly obey him. Even
a nation of people could become his friends. Jehovah
explained to the nation of Israel: “Obey my voice,
and I will become your God, and you will become my
people.” (Jeremiah 7:23) So you too need to obey Jehovah if you really want to become his friend.
JEHOVAH PROTECTS HIS FRIENDS
The Bible says that Jehovah is looking for ways
“to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart

125

is complete toward him.” (2 Chronicles 16:9) At
Psalm 32:8, Jehovah promises his friends: “I will give
you insight and instruct you in the way you should
go. I will give you advice with my eye upon you.”
5 A powerful enemy wants to stop us from being
God’s friends. But Jehovah wants to protect us. (Read
Psalm 55:22.) As friends of Jehovah, we serve him
with all our heart. We are loyal to him even under
di?cult circumstances. And we have the same con?dence that the psalmist had. He wrote about Jehovah:
“Because he is at my right hand, I will never be shaken.” (Psalm 16:8; 63:8) How does Satan try to stop us
from being God’s friends?
SATAN’S ACCUSATION
In Chapter 11 we learned that Satan challenged
Jehovah and accused him of being a liar and of being unfair by not allowing Adam and Eve to decide
for themselves what was right and what was wrong.
The Bible book of Job teaches us that Satan also accuses humans who want to be friends of God. Satan
claims that they serve God because of what they can
get from Him, not because they love Him. Satan even
claims that he can turn anyone against God. Let’s see
what we can learn from Job and how Jehovah protected him.
7 Who was Job? He was a good man who lived
about 3,600 years ago. Jehovah said that at that time
there was no man like him on the earth. Job had deep

respect for God, and he hated what was bad. (Job 1:8)
Yes, Job was a real friend of Jehovah.
8 Satan claimed that Job served God for sel?sh reasons. Satan said to Jehovah: “Have you not put up
a protective hedge [or, fence] around him and his
house and everything he has? You have blessed the
work of his hands, and his livestock has spread out in
the land. But, for a change, stretch out your hand and
strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you
to your very face.”—Job 1:10, 11.
9 Satan accused Job of serving Jehovah only for
what he could get from Him. Satan also claimed that
he could get Job to stop serving Jehovah. Jehovah
didn’t agree with Satan, but He gave Satan permission to test whether Job was a friend of Jehovah because he loved Him.
SATAN ATTACKS JOB
First, Satan stole or destroyed all the animals belonging to Job. Then Satan killed most of Job’s servants. Job lost everything. In a ?nal attack, Satan
killed Job’s ten children in a storm. But Job remained
loyal to Jehovah. “In all of this, Job did not sin or
accuse God of doing anything wrong.”—Job 1:1219, 22.
11 Satan did not give up. He challenged God by
saying: “Strike his bone and ?esh, and he will surely curse you to your very face.” So Satan struck Job
with a very painful disease. (Job 2:5, 7) Again, Job was

loyal to Jehovah. He said: “Until I die, I will not renounce [or, give up] my integrity!”—Job 27:5.
12 Job didn’t know anything about Satan’s accusations or why he was su?ering so much. He thought
that Jehovah was the cause of his troubles. (Job 6:4;
16:11-14) But even so, Job stayed loyal to Jehovah.
Now there was no doubt. Job was not sel?sh. He was
God’s friend because he loved Him. Satan’s accusations were all lies!
13 Even though Job did not know what was happening in heaven, he was loyal to God and proved
that Satan was evil. Jehovah rewarded Job for his loyal friendship.—Job 42:12-17.
HOW SATAN ACCUSES YOU
You can learn important lessons from what happened to Job. Today, Satan accuses us of serving Jehovah for what we can get from Him. At Job 2:4, Satan
claimed: “A man will give everything that he has for
his life.” So Satan accuses all men and women of being sel?sh, not just Job. Hundreds of years after Job
died, Satan was still insulting Jehovah and accusing
his servants. For example, at Proverbs 27:11, we read:
“Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice, so that I
can make a reply to him who taunts [or, insults] me.”
15 You can choose to obey Jehovah and be His loyal friend, proving that Satan is a liar. Even if you need
to make big changes in your life to become God’s
friend, it is the best decision you could ever make!

12. How did Job prove that Satan was a liar?

HOW CAN YOU BECOME GOD’S FRIEND?

129

This decision is a serious matter. Satan claims that
you will not be loyal to God when you have problems. He tries to trick us into being disloyal to God.
How so?
16 Satan uses many di?erent methods to try to stop
us from being God’s friend. He attacks “like a roaring
lion, seeking to devour someone.” (1 Peter 5:8) Do
not be surprised when your friends, family members,
or others try to stop you from studying the Bible and
from doing what is right. You may feel as if you are
being attacked.1 (John 15:19, 20) Satan also disguises himself “as an angel of light.” So he may try to
trick us into disobeying Jehovah. (2 Corinthians 11:
14) Another method Satan uses to try to stop us from
serving Jehovah is to make us think that we are never
good enough to serve God.—Proverbs 24:10.
OBEY JEHOVAH’S COMMANDMENTS
When we obey Jehovah, we prove that Satan is a
liar. What will help us to be obedient? The Bible says:
“You must love Jehovah your God with all your heart
and all your soul and all your strength.” (Deuteronomy 6:5) We obey Jehovah because we love him.
As our love for Jehovah grows, we will want to do
17

1 This doesn’t mean that Satan is controlling the people who try
to stop you from studying the Bible. But Satan is “the god of this
system of things,” and “the whole world is lying in [his] power.” So
it is not surprising when some people try to stop us from serving
Jehovah.—2 Corinthians 4:4; 1 John 5:19.

everything he asks us to do. The apostle John wrote:

his commandments; and yet his commandments are
not burdensome.”—1 John 5:3.
18 But what are some things that Jehovah tells us
are wrong? There are some examples in the box “Hate
What Jehovah Hates.” At ?rst, you might think that
some of these things are not so bad. But when you
read the Bible verses and carefully think about them,
you will understand the wisdom of obeying Jehovah’s laws. You may also feel that you need to make
some changes in your life. Even though this may be
di?cult at times, if you make those changes, you will

also make the way out so that you may be able to

Jehovah’s help during such times, Paul could say:

who gives me power.”—Philippians 4:13.
LEARN TO LOVE WHAT GOD LOVES
If we want to be Jehovah’s friend, we must stop
doing what Jehovah says is wrong, but we must also
do more. (Romans 12:9) God’s friends love what he
loves. They are described at Psalm 15:1-5. (Read.) Jehovah’s friends imitate his qualities and show “love,
joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control.”—Galatians 5:22, 23.
21 How can you learn to show those beautiful qualities? You need to learn what Jehovah loves by reading and studying the Bible regularly. (Isaiah 30:20,
21) As you do this, your love for Jehovah will grow,
and as your love for him grows, you will want to obey
him.
22 The changes that you may need to make in your
life can be compared to taking o? old clothes and
putting on new ones. The Bible says that you need
to “strip o? the old personality” and clothe yourself with “the new personality.” (Colossians 3:9, 10)
Even though it may not be easy, when we make these
changes and obey Jehovah, he promises to give us “a
large reward.” (Psalm 19:11) Yes, choose to obey Jehovah and prove that Satan is a liar. Serve Jehovah, not
because of any future reward, but because of unselfish love. Then you will become a real friend of God!

CHAPTER THIRTEEN

RESPECT THE GIFT OF LIFE
JEHOVAH “is the living God.” (Jeremiah 10:10) He is
our Creator, and he has given us life. The Bible says:
“You created all things, and because of your will they
came into existence and were created.” (Revelation 4:
11) Yes, Jehovah wanted us to have life. Life is a precious gift from him.—Read Psalm 36:9.
2 Jehovah gives us what we need to keep living,
such as food and water. (Acts 17:28) But more than
that, he wants us to enjoy life. (Acts 14:15-17) To be
successful in life, we need to obey God’s laws.—Isaiah
48:17, 18.
HOW GOD FEELS ABOUT LIFE
The Bible teaches us that our life and the lives
of other people are precious to Jehovah. For example, when Cain—Adam and Eve’s son—was very angry
with his younger brother Abel, Jehovah warned Cain
that he needed to control his anger. But Cain didn’t
listen, and he became so angry that he “assaulted his
brother Abel and killed him.” (Genesis 4:3-8) Jehovah punished Cain for murdering Abel. (Genesis 4:911) So anger and hatred are dangerous because they
can make us become violent or cruel. A person who is
like that cannot have everlasting life. (Read 1 John

RESPECT THE GIFT OF LIFE

137

3:15.) To please Jehovah, we must learn to love all
people.—1 John 3:11, 12.
4 Thousands of years later, Jehovah showed that he
viewed life as precious when he gave the Ten Commandments to Moses. One of the laws is: “You must
not murder.” (Deuteronomy 5:17) If a person killed
someone on purpose, he or she would be killed.
5 How does God feel about abortion? Even the life
of an unborn child is precious to Jehovah. In the Law
Jehovah gave to the Israelites, Jehovah said that if
someone injured a mother and her baby died because
of this, the person would be killed. (Read Exodus 21:
22, 23; Psalm 127:3.) This teaches us that abortion is
wrong.—See Endnote 28.
6 How can we show Jehovah that we view our own
life and the lives of others as precious? By not doing
anything that will endanger our life or other people’s
lives. So we will not use tobacco or betel nut or abuse
drugs, because they harm us and may kill us.
7 God gave us our life and our body, and we should
use them as he wants us to. So we need to take good
care of our body. If we don’t, we will become unclean
in God’s eyes. (Romans 6:19; 12:1; 2 Corinthians 7:1)
We cannot worship Jehovah, who gave us life, if we do
not view life as precious. Even though it may be very
hard to stop bad habits, Jehovah will help us if we are
making the e?ort because we view life as precious.
4. What does one of the laws God gave to the Israelites teach us
about the gift of life?
5. How does God feel about abortion?
6, 7. How do we show Jehovah that we view life as precious?

138

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

We have learned that life is a precious gift. Jehovah trusts that we will do our best never to endanger
our own life or the lives of others. We do this by the
way we drive our car, motorbike, or other vehicle.
We avoid dangerous or violent sports. (Psalm 11:5)
We also do our best to make our home safe. Jehovah commanded the Israelites: “If you build a new
house, you must also make a parapet [or, low wall]
for your roof, so that you may not bring bloodguilt
on your house because of someone falling from it.”
—Deuteronomy 22:8.
9 Even the way we treat animals is important to Jehovah. He allows us to kill animals for food and for
clothing, and he permits us to kill an animal if it
threatens our life. (Genesis 3:21; 9:3; Exodus 21:28)
But we cannot be cruel to animals or kill them just for
sport.—Proverbs 12:10.
RESPECT THE HOLINESS OF LIFE
Blood is holy to Jehovah because blood represents life. After Cain murdered Abel, Jehovah told
Cain: “Your brother’s blood is crying out to me from
the ground.” (Genesis 4:10) Abel’s blood represented
his life, and Jehovah punished Cain for killing Abel.
After the Flood of Noah’s day, Jehovah again showed
that blood represents life. Jehovah gave Noah and his
family permission to eat the ?esh of animals. He said:

life or the lives of others?

RESPECT THE GIFT OF LIFE

“Every moving animal that is alive may serve as food
for you. Just as I gave you the green vegetation, I give
them all to you.” However, there was one thing that
Jehovah commanded them not to eat: “Only ?esh
with its life—its blood—you must not eat.”—Genesis
1:29; 9:3, 4.
11 About 800 years after Jehovah told Noah not to
eat blood, he again commanded his people: “If one
of the Israelites or some foreigner who is residing
in your midst is hunting and catches a wild animal
or a bird that may be eaten, he must pour its blood
out and cover it with dust.” He then said: “You must
not eat the blood.” (Leviticus 17:13, 14) Jehovah still
wanted his people to view blood as holy. They could
eat meat but not the blood. When they killed an animal for food, they had to pour its blood onto the
ground.
12 Some years after Jesus’ death, the apostles and
the elders in the Christian congregation in Jerusalem
met to decide what parts of the Law given to the Israelites still applied to Christians. (Read Acts 15:28,
29; 21:25.) Jehovah helped them to understand that
blood was still precious to him and that they still
needed to view it as holy. The early Christians could
not eat or drink blood or eat meat that had not been
bled properly. If they did so, it was just as bad as worshipping idols or being sexually immoral. From that

time onward, true Christians have refused to eat or
drink blood. What about today? Jehovah still wants
us to view blood as holy.
13 Does this mean that Christians should also refuse blood transfusions? Yes, it does. Jehovah commanded us not to eat or drink blood. If a doctor told
you not to drink alcohol, would you inject it into
your body? Of course not! In the same way, the command not to eat or drink blood means that we would
not accept a blood transfusion.—See Endnote 29.
14 What if a doctor tells us that we will die if we do
not have a blood transfusion? Each person must decide whether to obey God’s law on blood. Christians
deeply respect God’s gift of life, and we will look for
alternative treatments to keep living; but we will not
accept a blood transfusion.
15 We try hard to keep healthy, but because life is
precious to God, we will not accept a blood transfusion. It is more important to obey Jehovah than to
try to extend our life by disobeying him. Jesus said:
“Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will ?nd it.” (Matthew 16:25) We want to obey Jehovah because we
love him. He knows what is best for us, and we view
life as precious and holy, as Jehovah does.—Hebrews
11:6.

his law about blood. They will not eat or drink blood,
and they will not accept blood for medical reasons.1
However, they will accept other treatments in order
to save their life. They are convinced that the Creator
of life and blood knows what is best for them. Do you
believe that he knows what is best for you?
THE ONLY USE OF BLOOD
THAT JEHOVAH ALLOWED
17 In the Law that God gave to Moses, Jehovah
told the Israelites: “The life of the ?esh is in the
blood, and I myself have given it on the altar for
you to make atonement [or, ask for forgiveness] for
yourselves, because it is the blood that makes atonement.” (Leviticus 17:11) When the Israelites sinned,
they could ask for Jehovah’s forgiveness by sacri?cing an animal and asking the priest to pour some of
its blood on the altar at the temple. This was the only
way Jehovah allowed the Israelites to use blood.
18 When Jesus came to earth, he replaced the law
on animal sacri?ces by giving his life, or blood, for
the forgiveness of our sins. (Matthew 20:28; Hebrews
10:1) Jesus’ life was so valuable that after Jehovah resurrected Jesus to heaven, Jehovah could give all humans the opportunity to live forever.—John 3:16; Hebrews 9:11, 12; 1 Peter 1:18, 19.

Witnesses.

We are grateful to Jehovah for his wonderful gift
of life! And we want to tell people that if they have
faith in Jesus, they can live forever. We love people, and we will do everything we can to teach them
how to get life. (Ezekiel 3:17-21) Then, like the apostle Paul, we will be able to say: “I am clean from the
blood of all men, for I have not held back from telling you all the counsel of God.” (Acts 20:26, 27) Yes,
we show that we deeply respect life and blood when
we tell others about Jehovah and how precious life is
to him.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN

YOUR FAMILY CAN BE HAPPY
JEHOVAH GOD performed the ?rst marriage. The
Bible tells us that he made the ?rst woman and
“brought her to the man.” Adam was so happy that
he said: “This is at last bone of my bones and ?esh of
my ?esh.” (Genesis 2:22, 23) This tells us that Jehovah wants married people to be happy.
2 Sadly, many people have never experienced a
happy family life. However, the Bible contains many
principles that will help all members of the family to
make their family life successful and to enjoy being
together.—Luke 11:28.
WHAT GOD EXPECTS FROM HUSBANDS
3

The Bible says that a good husband should treat
his wife with love and respect. Please read Ephesians
5:25-29. A husband will always treat his wife in a loving way. He will also protect her, look after her, and
do nothing that would harm her.
4 But what should a husband do when his wife
makes mistakes? Husbands are told: “Keep on loving
your wives and do not be bitterly angry with them.”
(Colossians 3:19) Husbands, remember that you too
make mistakes. And if you want God to forgive you,
you must forgive your wife. (Matthew 6:12, 14, 15)

3, 4. (a) How should a husband treat his wife? (b) Why is it important for a husband and wife to forgive each other?

146

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

When a husband and wife are both willing to forgive, it will help them to have a happy marriage.
5 Jehovah expects a husband to honor his wife.
A husband should think carefully about his wife’s
needs. This is a very serious matter. If a husband does
not treat his wife well, Jehovah may refuse to listen
to his prayers. (1 Peter 3:7) What makes people valuable to Jehovah is that they love him. He does not
prefer men over women.
6 Jesus explained that a husband and wife “are no
longer two, but one flesh.” (Matthew 19:6) They are
loyal to each other and would never be unfaithful
to each other. (Proverbs 5:15-21; Hebrews 13:4) Husbands and wives should unsel?shly care for each other’s sexual needs. (1 Corinthians 7:3-5) A husband
should remember that “no man ever hated his own
body, but he feeds and cherishes it.” So he should
love and cherish his wife. More than anything else, a
wife wants her husband to be kind and loving to her.
—Ephesians 5:29.
WHAT GOD EXPECTS
FROM WIVES

Every family needs a head, someone to guide the
family so that they work well together. The Bible says
at 1 Corinthians 11:3: “The head of every man is the
Christ; in turn, the head of a woman is the man; in
turn, the head of the Christ is God.”

How is Sarah a good example for wives?
8 Every husband makes mistakes. But when a wife
supports her husband’s decisions and cooperates
with him willingly, the whole family bene?ts. (1 Peter 3:1-6) The Bible says: “The wife should have deep
respect for her husband.” (Ephesians 5:33) What if a
husband does not share his wife’s beliefs? She still
needs to have deep respect for him. The Bible says:
“You wives, be in subjection to your husbands, so
that if any are not obedient to the word, they may be
won without a word through the conduct of their
wives, because of having been eyewitnesses of your
chaste conduct together with deep respect.” (1 Peter
3:1, 2) A wife’s good example can help her husband
to understand and respect her faith.

respectful way. For example, Sarah said something
that Abraham did not like, but Jehovah told him:
“Listen to her.” (Genesis 21:9-12) Rarely will a Christian husband’s ?nal decision be against what the Bible says, so his wife should support him. (Acts 5:29;
Ephesians 5:24) A good wife will take care of the family. (Read Titus 2:4, 5.) When her husband and children see how hard she works for them, they will love
and respect her even more.—Proverbs 31:10, 28.
10 Sometimes couples quickly decide to separate or
divorce. However, the Bible says that “a wife should
not separate from her husband” and that “a husband should not leave his wife.” (1 Corinthians 7:10,
11) There are certain extreme circumstances when
couples may separate, but this is a serious decision.
What about divorce? The Bible shows that the only
valid reason for divorce is if a husband or a wife has
sex with someone other than his or her mate.—Matthew 19:9.
WHAT GOD EXPECTS FROM PARENTS
11

Parents, spend as much time as possible with
your children. Your children need you, and more
than anything else, they need you to teach them
about Jehovah.—Deuteronomy 6:4-9.
12 Satan’s world is becoming more and more wicked, and there are some people who may want to
harm our children, even sexually abuse them. Some

parents ?nd it di?cult to talk about this subject. But
parents need to warn their children about such people and teach them how to avoid them. Parents, you
must protect your children.1—1 Peter 5:8.
13 Parents have the responsibility to teach their
children how to behave. How can you teach your
children? Your children need training, but correction should never be cruel or harsh. (Jeremiah 30:11)

So never discipline your children when you are angry. You do not want your words to be like “the stabs
of a sword” and hurt them. (Proverbs 12:18) Teach
your children to understand why they need to be
obedient.—Ephesians 6:4; Hebrews 12:9-11; see Endnote 30.
WHAT GOD EXPECTS FROM CHILDREN
14

Jesus always obeyed his Father, even when it was
not easy. (Luke 22:42; John 8:28, 29) Jehovah also expects children to obey their parents.—Ephesians 6:
1-3.
15 Children, even if you feel that it is hard for you
to obey your parents, remember that when you are
obedient, Jehovah and your parents are pleased with
you.1—Proverbs 1:8; 6:20; 23:22-25.
16 The Devil can use your friends and other young
people to tempt you to do what is wrong. He knows
that this pressure can be very hard to resist. For
example, Jacob’s daughter Dinah had friends who
didn’t love Jehovah. This caused a lot of trouble for
her and her family. (Genesis 34:1, 2) If your friends
do not love Jehovah, they may tempt you to do
something that Jehovah hates, which would cause a
lot of pain to you, to your family, and to God. (Proverbs 17:21, 25) That is why it is very important that

something that is against God’s law.—Acts 5:29.

you ?nd friends who love Jehovah.—1 Corinthians

YOUR FAMILY CAN BE HAPPY
When the members of a family follow God’s instructions, they avoid trouble and many problems.
So if you are a husband, love your wife and treat her
with love. If you are a wife, be respectful and submissive to your husband and imitate the example of the
wife described at Proverbs 31:10-31. If you are a parent, teach your children to love God. (Proverbs 22:6)
If you are a father, guide your family “in a ?ne manner.” (1 Timothy 3:4, 5; 5:8) And children, obey your
parents. (Colossians 3:20) Remember that each person in the family can make mistakes, so be humble
and ask one another for forgiveness. Yes, the Bible
contains Jehovah’s guidance for every person in the
family.

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

THE RIGHT WAY
TO WORSHIP GOD
MOST religions claim that they teach the truth about
God. But that is not possible, because religions teach
very di?erent things about who God is and how we
should worship him. How can we know the right way
to worship God? Jehovah is the only one who can tell
us how we should worship him.
2 Jehovah has given us the Bible so that we can
learn the right way to worship him. So study the Bible, and Jehovah will help you to bene?t from his
teachings because he deeply cares for you.—Isaiah
48:17.
3 Some people say that God accepts all religions,
but that’s not what Jesus taught us. He said: “Not
everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into
the Kingdom of the heavens, but only the one doing
the will of my Father.” So it is necessary for us to
learn what the will of God is and then to do it. This
is a serious matter because Jesus compared people
who do not obey God to criminals, “workers of lawlessness.”—Matthew 7:21-23.
4 Jesus warned us that when we want to do the

will of God, we will face challenges. He said: “Go in
through the narrow gate, because broad is the gate
and spacious is the road leading o? into destruction,
and many are going in through it; whereas narrow
is the gate and cramped the road leading o? into
life, and few are ?nding it.” (Matthew 7:13, 14) The
cramped road, or the right way to worship God, leads
to everlasting life. The spacious road, or the wrong
way to worship God, leads to death. But Jehovah does
not want anyone to die. He gives everyone the opportunity to learn about him.—2 Peter 3:9.
THE RIGHT WAY TO WORSHIP GOD
5

Jesus said that we can identify those who worship God in the right way. We do this by examining
what they believe and what they do. He said: “By
their fruits you will recognize them.” And he added:
“Every good tree produces ?ne fruit.” (Matthew 7:16,
17) This doesn’t mean that those who worship God
are perfect. But God’s servants always try to do what
is right. We will now see what will help us to identify those who worship God the right way.
6 Our worship should be based on the Bible. The
Bible says: “All Scripture is inspired of God and bene?cial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things
straight, for disciplining in righteousness, so that
the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.” (2 Timothy 3:16,
5. How can you identify those who worship God in the right way?
6, 7. Why is true worship based on the Bible? What does Jesus’ example teach us?

156

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

17) The apostle Paul wrote to Christians: “When you
received God’s word, which you heard from us, you
accepted it not as the word of men but, just as it
truthfully is, as the word of God.” (1 Thessalonians
2:13) True worship is based only on God’s Word, the
Bible. It is not based on human ideas, traditions, or
anything else.
7 Everything Jesus taught was based on God’s
Word. (Read John 17:17.) He often quoted the Scriptures. (Matthew 4:4, 7, 10) True servants of God follow Jesus’ example and base everything they teach
on the Bible.
8 We should worship only Jehovah. Psalm 83:
18 says: “You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone
are the Most High over all the earth.” Jesus wanted
people to know exactly who the true God is, and he
taught people God’s name. (Read John 17:6.) Jesus
said: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and
it is to him alone you must render sacred service.”
(Matthew 4:10) So, as God’s servants, we follow Jesus’ example. We worship only Jehovah, we use his
name, and we teach others God’s name and what he
will do for us.
9 We need to have genuine love for people. Jesus
taught his disciples to love one another. (Read John
13:35.) It doesn’t matter where we’re from, what our
culture is, or whether we are rich or poor. Our love
for one another should unite us as brothers and sisters. (Colossians 3:14) So we do not go to war and kill

157

people. The Bible says: “The children of God and the
children of the Devil are evident by this fact: Whoever does not practice righteousness does not originate with God, nor does the one who does not love
his brother.” And it adds: “We should love one another; not like Cain, who originated with the wicked
one and slaughtered his brother.”—1 John 3:10-12; 4:
20, 21.
10 We use our time, energy, and material things to
help and encourage one another. (Hebrews 10:24, 25)
We “work what is good toward all.”—Galatians 6:10.
11 We need to obey Jesus because he is the way to
God. The Bible says: “There is no salvation in anyone else, for there is no other name under heaven
that has been given among men by which we must
get saved.” (Acts 4:12) In Chapter 5 of this book, we
learned that Jehovah sent Jesus to give his life as a
ransom for obedient humans. (Matthew 20:28) Jehovah has chosen Jesus to rule as King over the earth.
That is why the Bible tells us that we must obey Jesus
if we want to live forever.—Read John 3:36.
12 We should not get involved in politics. Jesus
didn’t participate in politics. When he was on trial,
he told the Roman ruler Pilate: “My Kingdom is
no part of this world.” (Read John 18:36.) Like Jesus, we are loyal to God’s heavenly Kingdom, and
for this reason, no matter where we live, we do not
get involved in politics. However, the Bible commands us to obey “the superior authorities,” that is,
11. Why do we accept Jesus as the way to God?

158

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

the governments. (Romans 13:1) We obey the laws of
the country where we live. Of course, when a law
con?icts with God’s laws, we imitate the apostles,
who said: “We must obey God as ruler rather than
men.”—Acts 5:29; Mark 12:17.
13 We believe that God’s Kingdom is the only solution for the world’s problems. Jesus said that the
“good news of the Kingdom” would be preached all
over the world. (Read Matthew 24:14.) No human
government can do what God’s Kingdom will do for
us. (Psalm 146:3) Jesus taught us to pray for God’s
Kingdom when he said: “Let your Kingdom come.
Let your will take place, as in heaven, also on earth.”
(Matthew 6:10) The Bible tells us that God’s Kingdom will destroy all human governments and that
“it alone will stand forever.”—Daniel 2:44.
14 After studying these points, ask yourself: ‘Who
base their teachings on the Bible? Who tell others
about God’s name? Who show genuine love toward
one another and believe that God sent Jesus to save
us? Who do not get involved in politics? Who preach
that only God’s Kingdom can solve our problems?’ It
is only Jehovah’s Witnesses.—Isaiah 43:10-12.
WHAT WILL YOU DO?
It’s not enough just to believe God exists. Even
the demons believe God exists, but they don’t obey
him. (James 2:19) If we want God to accept our wor15

ship, we must not only believe he exists but also do
what he says.
16 For God to accept our worship, we must reject
false religion. The prophet Isaiah wrote: “Get out
from the midst of her, keep yourselves clean.” (Isaiah
52:11; 2 Corinthians 6:17) That is why we need to reject anything that has to do with false worship.
17 What is false religion? It is any religion that
teaches us to worship God in a way that is against his
Word. The Bible calls all false religion “Babylon the
Great.” (Revelation 17:5) Why? After the Flood of
Noah’s day, many false religious teachings started in
the city of Babylon. Those false teachings spread all
over the earth. For example, the people living in Babylon worshipped groups of three gods. Today, too,
many religions teach that God is a Trinity, but the Bible clearly teaches that there is only one true God, Jehovah, and that Jesus is his Son. (John 17:3) People
living in Babylon also believed that part of a person
continues living after the body dies and that that
part can su?er in hell. That is not true.—See Endnotes 14, 17, and 18.
18 God has foretold that soon all false religion will
be destroyed. (Revelation 18:8) Do you understand
why leaving false religion is so urgent? Jehovah God
wants you to do that before it’s too late.—Revelation
18:4.

You will become part of a worldwide family of millions of people who truly love one another, and you

world. (Mark 10:28-30) Perhaps some of the friends
and family who oppose your decision to serve Jehovah will later decide to study the Bible.
20 Very soon, God will destroy all wickedness and
his Kingdom will rule over the earth. (2 Peter 3:9, 13)

Jehovah the way Jehovah wants us to. So it’s important for you to take action now and worship God in

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

CHOOSE TO WORSHIP GOD
THROUGH your study of the Bible, you have learned
that many people who claim to worship God actually
teach or practice things that God hates. (2 Corinthians 6:17) That is why Jehovah commands us to get
out of false religion, “Babylon the Great.” (Revelation
18:2, 4) What will you do? Each of us has a choice to
make, and we must ask ourselves, ‘Do I want to worship God in the way that he wants me to, or do I want
to worship him the way I always have?’
2 If you have already left or resigned from a false religion, that is good. But deep inside there may be
some practices and customs of false religion that you
still enjoy. Let us discuss some of those practices and
customs and see why it is so important that we view
them the way Jehovah views them.
IMAGES AND ANCESTOR WORSHIP
Some people have used images or shrines in their
home to worship God for many years. If that is true of
you, it may feel strange or even wrong to worship
God without them. But remember, Jehovah teaches
us how to worship him. And the Bible clearly tells us
that Jehovah does not want us to use images in our

worship.—Read Exodus 20:4, 5; Psalm 115:4-8; Isaiah
42:8; 1 John 5:21.
4 Some people may spend a lot of time and energy
trying to please their dead ancestors. They may even
worship them. But we have learned that those who
have died cannot help us or hurt us. They are not living somewhere else. Actually, it is dangerous to try to
communicate with them because any message that
appears to come from a dead relative would in fact be
from the demons. That is why Jehovah commanded
the Israelites not to try to talk with the dead or get involved in any other sort of demonism.—Deuteronomy 18:10-12; see Endnotes 26 and 31.
5 What can help you to stop using images to worship God or to stop worshipping your ancestors? You
need to read the Bible and think carefully about how
Jehovah views those things. He views them as “detestable,” or disgusting. (Deuteronomy 27:15) Pray to Jehovah every day for help to view things as he does and
for help to worship him in the way that he wants. (Isaiah 55:9) You can be sure that Jehovah will give you
the strength you need to remove from your life anything related to false worship.
SHOULD WE CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS?
Around the world, Christmas is one of the most
popular holidays, and most people think that it is

166

a celebration of the birth of Jesus. But Christmas
is actually connected with false worship. One encyclopedia explains that Roman pagans celebrated the
birthday of the sun on December 25. Church leaders
wanted more pagans to become Christians, so even
though Jesus was not born on December 25, they decided to celebrate Jesus’ birth on that date. (Luke 2:812) Jesus’ disciples did not celebrate Christmas. One
reference book explains that in the 200 years after Jesus’ birth, “no one knew, and few people cared, exactly when he was born.” (Sacred Origins of Profound
Things) Christmas celebrations started several hundred years after Jesus lived on earth.
7 Many people know about the pagan origins of
Christmas and its traditions, such as partying and
gift-giving. For example, in England and parts of
America, there was a time when celebrating Christmas was forbidden because of its pagan origins. Anyone who celebrated it was punished. But eventually people began to celebrate Christmas again. Why
do true Christians not celebrate Christmas? Because
they want to please God in everything they do.
SHOULD WE CELEBRATE BIRTHDAYS?
Another popular celebration for many people is
their birthday. Should Christians celebrate birthdays?
The only birthday celebrations mentioned in the Bible were held by those who did not worship Jehovah.
(Genesis 40:20; Mark 6:21) Birthday celebrations were
used to honor false gods. That is why the early Chris8

CHOOSE TO WORSHIP GOD

167

tians “considered the celebration of anyone’s birth to
be a pagan custom.”—The World Book Encyclopedia.
9 The ancient Romans and Greeks believed that a
spirit was present at each person’s birth and that this
spirit would protect the person during his life. “This
spirit had a mystic relation with the god on whose
birthday the individual was born,” explains the book
The Lore of Birthdays.
10 Do you think that Jehovah approves of celebrations that are connected with false religion? (Isaiah
65:11, 12) No, he does not. That is why we do not celebrate birthdays or any holiday connected with false
religion.
DOES IT REALLY MATTER?
Some people know the pagan origins of Christmas and other holidays, but they continue to celebrate them. They feel that holidays are just a good opportunity to spend time with their family. Is that how
you feel? It is not wrong to want to spend time with
your family. Jehovah created the family, and he wants
us to have a good relationship with them. (Ephesians
3:14, 15) However, we need to focus on having a good
relationship with Jehovah rather than on pleasing our
relatives by celebrating false religious holidays. That is
why the apostle Paul said: “Keep on making sure of
what is acceptable to the Lord.”—Ephesians 5:10.

168

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

from doesn’t really matter, but Jehovah doesn’t feel
that way. He does not approve of holidays that come
from false worship or that exalt humans or national
symbols. For example, the Egyptians had many celebrations for their false gods. After the Israelites escaped from Egypt, they copied one of their pagan celebrations and called it “a festival to Jehovah.” But
Jehovah punished them for doing that. (Exodus 32:
2-10) As the prophet Isaiah said, we should “touch
nothing unclean!”—Read Isaiah 52:11.
BE KIND WHEN DEALING WITH OTHERS
When you decide to stop celebrating holidays,
you may have many questions. For example: What
should I do if my workmates ask why I do not celebrate Christmas with them? What should I do if
someone gives me a Christmas gift? What should I
do if my marriage mate expects me to celebrate a holiday? How can I help my children not to feel sad because of not celebrating a holiday or their birthday?
14 It is important to use common sense when you
decide what to say and do in each situation. For example, if people wish you a happy holiday, you don’t
need to ignore them. You can simply say, “Thank
you.” But in situations where someone would like to
know more, you might choose to explain why you
don’t celebrate a holiday. However, always be kind,
tactful, and respectful. The Bible says: “Let your

words always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that
you will know how you should answer each person.”
(Colossians 4:6) Perhaps you could explain that you
do enjoy spending time with others and giving gifts
but that you just choose not to do so in connection
with these holidays.
15 What should you do if someone gives you a gift?
The Bible does not give a list of rules, but it does say
that we should keep a good conscience. (1 Timothy 1:
18, 19) Maybe the person giving you the gift doesn’t
know that you don’t celebrate a holiday. Or he might
say, “I know that you don’t celebrate the holiday, but
I still want to give you this.” In either case, you can decide if you will accept the gift or not. But whatever decision you make, be sure to keep a good conscience.
We would not want to do anything that would a?ect
our relationship with Jehovah in a bad way.
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
What should you do if your family wants to celebrate a holiday? You don’t have to ?ght with them.
Remember, they have the right to decide what they
want to do. Be kind and respect their choices just as
you want them to respect yours. (Read Matthew 7:
12.) But if your family wants you to spend time with
them during the holiday, what should you do? Before
you decide what to do, pray to Jehovah for help to
make the right decision. Think about the situation,
and do research about it. Remember, you always want
to please Jehovah.

What can you do to help your children when
they see others celebrating holidays? Well, from
time to time, you can organize something special for
them. You can also surprise them with gifts. And one
of the best gifts you can give your children is your
time and your love.
PRACTICE TRUE WORSHIP
To please Jehovah, we need to abandon false religion as well as customs and holidays related to it. But
we also need to practice true worship. How? One way
is by regularly attending Christian meetings. (Read
Hebrews 10:24, 25.) The meetings are a very important part of true worship. (Psalm 22:22; 122:1) We
can encourage one another when we meet together.
—Romans 1:12.
19 Another part of choosing true worship is speaking to others about what you have learned from the
Bible. Many people feel distressed about the wicked things happening on the earth. Maybe you know
some who feel that way. Tell them about your wonderful hope for the future. As you attend Christian
meetings and tell others about Bible truth, you will
discover that you no longer feel the desire to be part
of false religion and its customs. You can be sure that
you will be happy and that Jehovah will greatly bless
your e?orts as you choose to worship him in the right
way.—Malachi 3:10.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

THE PRIVILEGE
OF PRAYER
COMPARED to the universe, the earth is very small.
When Jehovah looks at the earth, all the people in all
the nations seem like just a tiny drop of water from a
bucket. (Psalm 115:15; Isaiah 40:15) Even though we
are so small when compared to the universe, Psalm
145:18, 19 says: “Jehovah is near to all those calling
on him, to all who call on him in truth. He satis?es the desire of those who fear him; he hears their
cry for help, and he rescues them.” What an amazing privilege we have! Jehovah, the almighty Creator,
wants to be close to us, and he wants to listen to our
prayers. Yes, prayer is a privilege, a special gift that Jehovah has given to each one of us.
2 But Jehovah will listen to us only if we talk to him
in the way he approves. How can we do that? Let’s see
what the Bible says about prayer.
WHY PRAY TO JEHOVAH?
Jehovah wants you to pray, or talk, to him. How
do we know that? Please read Philippians 4:6, 7.
Think about that kind invitation. The Ruler of the
universe is deeply interested in you and wants you to
tell him about how you feel and about your problems.

need to know what the Bible teaches about it?
3. Why should you pray to Jehovah?

175

“The Maker of heaven
and earth” wants to hear
our prayers.—Psalm 115:15

4

Prayer helps us to have a close friendship with
Jehovah. When friends regularly talk to each other
about their thoughts, concerns, and feelings, their
friendship grows stronger. It’s similar with prayer
to Jehovah. Through the Bible, he has shared his
thoughts and feelings with you, and he tells you what
he will do in the future. You can share even your
deepest feelings with him by talking to him regularly. As you do this, your friendship with Jehovah will
grow much stronger.—James 4:8.
WHAT MUST WE DO
TO BE HEARD BY GOD?
5 Does Jehovah listen to all prayers? No, he does
not. In the time of the prophet Isaiah, Jehovah told
the Israelites: “Although you o?er many prayers, I am

with him?

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

not listening; your hands are ?lled with blood.” (Isaiah 1:15) So if we are not careful, we could do things
that would distance us from Jehovah, causing him to
ignore our prayers.
6 If we want Jehovah to listen to our prayers, we
must have faith in him. (Mark 11:24) The apostle Paul explains: “Without faith it is impossible to
please God well, for whoever approaches God must
believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder
of those earnestly seeking him.” (Hebrews 11:6) But
it is not enough just to say that we have faith. We
need to prove our faith clearly by obeying Jehovah
every day.—Read James 2:26.
7 We should be humble and respectful as we pray
to Jehovah. Why? If we were to speak to a king or
a president, we would do so in a respectful way. Jehovah is Almighty God, so shouldn’t we show even
more respect and humility when we speak to him?
(Genesis 17:1; Psalm 138:6) We should also be sincere
and pray to Jehovah from our heart, not just repeating the same words over and over again.—Matthew 6:
7, 8.
8 Finally, when we pray about something, we must
do everything we can to work at what we are praying
for. For example, if we pray to Jehovah for our daily
needs, then we can’t be lazy and expect Jehovah to
give us everything even though we are able to work

for it. We must work hard and accept whatever job we
are able to do. (Matthew 6:11; 2 Thessalonians 3:10)
Or if we pray to Jehovah for help to stop doing something wrong, we must avoid any situation that could
tempt us. (Colossians 3:5) Let’s now examine some
common questions about prayer.
COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT PRAYER
To whom should we pray? Jesus taught his followers to pray to “our Father in the heavens.” (Matthew 6:9) He also said: “I am the way and the truth
and the life. No one comes to the Father except
through me.” (John 14:6) So we should pray only to
Jehovah through Jesus. What does praying through
Jesus mean? For Jehovah to accept our prayers, we
need to show respect for the special assignment Jehovah gave to Jesus. As we learned, Jesus came to earth
to save us from sin and death. (John 3:16; Romans 5:
12) Jehovah has also appointed Jesus as High Priest
and Judge.—John 5:22; Hebrews 6:20.
10 Do we need to be in a special position when we
pray? No, Jehovah doesn’t ask us to kneel, sit, or stand
when we pray. The Bible teaches us that we can talk to
Jehovah in any respectful position. (1 Chronicles 17:
16; Nehemiah 8:6; Daniel 6:10; Mark 11:25) What is
most important to Jehovah is, not our position when
we pray, but that we talk to him with the right attitude. We can pray out loud or silently wherever we are
and at anytime during the day or night. When we pray

178

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

to Jehovah, we can trust that he will hear us even
when nobody else does.—Nehemiah 2:1-6.
11 What can we pray for? We can pray for anything
that is acceptable to Jehovah. The Bible says: “No
matter what we ask according to his will, he hears
us.” (1 John 5:14) Can we pray about personal things?
Yes. Praying to Jehovah should be like talking to a
close friend. We can tell Jehovah anything that’s on
our mind and in our heart. (Psalm 62:8) We can pray
for him to give us his powerful holy spirit to help us
do what’s right. (Luke 11:13) We can also ask Jehovah
for wisdom to make good decisions, and we can pray
for strength to cope with di?culties. (James 1:5) We
should ask Jehovah to forgive our sins. (Ephesians 1:
3, 7) We should also pray for others, including our
family and our brothers and sisters in the congregation.—Acts 12:5; Colossians 4:12.
12 What should be most important in our
prayers? Jehovah and his will. We should thank
him from our heart for everything he has done for
us. (1 Chronicles 29:10-13) We know this because
when Jesus was on earth, he taught his disciples how
to pray. (Read Matthew 6:9-13.) He said that they
should ?rst pray for God’s name to be sancti?ed, that
is, treated as sacred or holy. Then Jesus showed that
we should pray for God’s Kingdom to come and for
Jehovah’s will to be done all over the earth. It was
only after praying for those very important things
that Jesus said that we should pray for our personal

THE PRIVILEGE OF PRAYER

179

needs. When we put Jehovah and his will ?rst in our
prayers, we show what is most important to us.
13 How long should our prayers be? The Bible
doesn’t say. Our prayers can be short or long, depending on the situation. For example, we might say a
short prayer before we eat but a longer prayer when
we are giving Jehovah thanks or telling him about
13. How long should our prayers be?

You can pray anytime

180

Jehovah can answer our prayers through
the help we get from other Christians

our concerns. (1 Samuel 1:12, 15) We don’t want to
say long prayers just to impress others, as some people did in Jesus’ day. (Luke 20:46, 47) Jehovah is not
impressed by prayers like those. What’s important to
Jehovah is that we pray from our heart.
14 How often should we pray? Jehovah invites us
to talk to him regularly. The Bible says that we should
“pray continually,” “persevere in prayer,” and “pray
constantly.” (Matthew 26:41; Romans 12:12; 1 Thessalonians 5:17) Jehovah is always ready to listen to us.
We can thank him every day for his love and generosity. We can also ask him for his guidance, strength,

Jehovah?

THE PRIVILEGE OF PRAYER

181

and comfort. If we truly value the privilege we have
to pray to Jehovah, we will use every opportunity to
talk to him.
15 Why should we say “amen” at the end of a
prayer? The word “amen” means “surely” or “so be
it.” It is a way of showing that we mean what we said
in our prayer, that is, that we are sincere. (Psalm 41:
13) The Bible teaches us that it is also good to say
“amen,” either silently or out loud, at the end of a
public prayer to show that we agree with what was
said.—1 Chronicles 16:36; 1 Corinthians 14:16.
HOW GOD ANSWERS OUR PRAYERS
Does Jehovah really answer our prayers? Yes, he
does. The Bible calls him the “Hearer of prayer.”
(Psalm 65:2) Jehovah hears and answers the sincere
prayers of millions of humans, and he does so in
many di?erent ways.
17 Jehovah uses angels and his servants on earth
to provide the answer to our prayers. (Hebrews 1:13,
14) There are many examples of people who prayed
for help in understanding the Bible and shortly after
that received a visit from one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
The Bible shows that the angels are involved in declaring “good news” all over the earth. (Read Revelation 14:6.) Also, many of us have prayed to Jehovah about a speci?c problem or need and have then

received the help we needed from a Christian brother or sister.—Proverbs 12:25; James 2:16.
18 Jehovah uses his holy spirit to answer our
prayers. When we pray for help to cope with a problem, he may use his holy spirit to give us guidance
and strength. (2 Corinthians 4:7) Jehovah also uses
the Bible to answer our prayers and to help us to make
wise decisions. When we read the Bible, we may ?nd
scriptures that will help us. Jehovah can also motivate
someone who comments at a meeting to say what we
need to hear or an elder in the congregation to share
a point from the Bible with us.—Galatians 6:1.
19 Sometimes, though, we might wonder, ‘Why
hasn’t Jehovah answered my prayers yet?’ Remember,
he knows when and how to answer our prayers. He
knows what we need. We may have to keep on praying for a time to show that we really mean what we
say to him and to show him that we truly have faith
in him. (Luke 11:5-10) Sometimes Jehovah answers
our prayers in a way that we may not expect. For example, we may pray about a di?cult situation, but instead of removing the problem, he may give us the
strength to endure it.—Read Philippians 4:13.
20 What an amazing privilege we have to pray to
Jehovah! We can be sure that he will listen to us.
(Psalm 145:18) And the more often we pray to Jehovah from our heart, the stronger our friendship with
him will become.

YOU have learned many Bible truths during your
study of this book, such as God’s promise of eternal life, the condition of the dead, and the hope of
the resurrection. (Ecclesiastes 9:5; Luke 23:43; John
5:28, 29; Revelation 21:3, 4) You may have started
to attend meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses and believe that they practice true worship. (John 13:35)
You may have begun to develop a close friendship
with Jehovah, and you may have decided that you

want to serve him. So you might think, ‘What should
I do now to serve God?’
2 That is what an Ethiopian man thought who
lived in Jesus’ time. Sometime after Jesus was resurrected, Jesus’ disciple Philip preached to the man.
Philip proved to him that Jesus was the Messiah. The
Ethiopian man was so moved by what he learned that
he immediately said: “Look! Here is water; what prevents me from getting baptized?”—Acts 8:26-36.
3 The Bible clearly teaches that if you want to serve
Jehovah, you should get baptized. Jesus told his followers: “Make disciples of people of all the nations,
baptizing them.” (Matthew 28:19) Jesus also set the
example by getting baptized himself. He was completely immersed in water, not just sprinkled with
water on his head. (Matthew 3:16) Today when a
Christian is baptized, he must also be completely immersed, or dipped, in water.
4 When you get baptized, it shows others that you
really want to be God’s friend and to serve him.
(Psalm 40:7, 8) So you may wonder, ‘What do I need
to do to get baptized?’

know Jehovah and Jesus. You have already started

to do this by studying the Bible. (Read John 17:3.)
But that is not enough. The Bible says that you must
be “?lled with the accurate knowledge” of Jehovah’s
will. (Colossians 1:9) The meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses will help you to have a closer relationship with
Jehovah. That is one important reason for you to attend those meetings regularly.—Hebrews 10:24, 25.
6 Of course, Jehovah does not expect you to know
everything in the Bible before you get baptized. He
didn’t expect the Ethiopian man to know everything
before he got baptized. (Acts 8:30, 31) And we will
continue learning about God forever. (Ecclesiastes 3:
11) But to get baptized, you need to know and accept at least the basic teachings of the Bible.—Hebrews 5:12.
7 The Bible says: “Without faith it is impossible
to please God.” (Hebrews 11:6) So you need to have
faith before you can get baptized. The Bible tells us
that some people in the ancient city of Corinth heard
what Jesus’ followers taught and, as a result, “began to believe and be baptized.” (Acts 18:8) Similarly,
your study of the Bible has helped you to have faith
in God’s promises and in the power of Jesus’ sacri?ce,
which can save us from sin and death.—Joshua 23:14;
Acts 4:12; 2 Timothy 3:16, 17.

helps you in your life, your faith will get stronger.
You will want to tell others about what you’re learning. (Jeremiah 20:9; 2 Corinthians 4:13) But whom
should you tell?
9 You may want to tell your family, friends, neighbors, or workmates about what you are learning. That
is good, but always do this in a kind and loving way.
Eventually, you will be able to begin preaching with
the congregation. When you feel ready to do so, you
can talk to the Witness who is teaching you the Bible
and tell him or her that you would like to share in the
preaching work with the congregation. If that person
thinks that you are ready and if you are living your
life according to Bible standards, then together you
will meet with two elders in the congregation.
10 What will happen at that meeting? The elders
will talk with you to see if you understand and believe basic Bible teachings, if you obey what the Bible says in your daily life, and if you really want to
become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Remember that
the elders take care of all the members of the congregation, including you, so don’t be afraid to talk to
them. (Acts 20:28; 1 Peter 5:2, 3) After this meeting,
the elders will let you know if you can begin preaching with the congregation.
11 The elders might explain to you that you need to
make more changes before you can begin preaching
9, 10. (a) With whom might you begin sharing what you’ve
learned? (b) What should you do if you want to preach with the congregation?
11. Why is it so important to make changes before you can preach

SHOULD I DEDICATE MY LIFE TO GOD AND BE BAPTIZED?

189

with the congregation. Why is it so important to make
those changes? Because when we talk to others about
God, we represent Jehovah and must live in a way that
honors him.—1 Corinthians 6:9, 10; Galatians 5:19-21.
REPENT AND TURN AROUND
There is something else that you must do before
you can get baptized. The apostle Peter said: “Repent,
therefore, and turn around so as to get your sins blotted out.” (Acts 3:19) What does it mean to repent? It
means to feel very sorry for any wrong that we have
done. For example, if you lived a sexually immoral
life, then you would need to repent. And even if all
your life you have tried your best to do what is right,
you still need to repent, because we all sin and need
to ask God for his forgiveness.—Romans 3:23; 5:12.
13 Is it enough just to feel sorry for what you have
done? No. Peter said that you also need to “turn
around.” This means that you need to reject any former wrong conduct and start doing what is right. To
illustrate this, imagine that you are traveling to a certain place for the ?rst time. After a while, you discover that you are going in the wrong direction. What
would you do? No doubt you would slow down, stop,
turn around, and then go in the right direction. Similarly, as you study the Bible, you might discover that
there are some habits or things in your life that you
need to change. Be willing to “turn around”—that is,
to make the necessary changes—and begin to do what
is right.

13. What does it mean to “turn around”?

190

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

MAKE A PERSONAL DEDICATION
Another important step you need to take before
getting baptized is to dedicate yourself to Jehovah.
When you dedicate yourself to Jehovah, you say a
prayer in which you promise to worship only him
and to make his will the most important thing in
your life.—Deuteronomy 6:15.
15 Promising to serve only Jehovah is like promising to spend the rest of your life with a person you
love. Imagine that a man and a woman are dating. As
the man gets to know the woman better, he comes to
love her and he wants to marry her. Even though this
is a serious decision, the man is willing to accept this
responsibility because he loves her.
16 As you learn about Jehovah, you come to love
him and want to do your best to serve him. This will
motivate you to say a prayer promising to serve him.
The Bible says that anyone who wants to follow Jesus
must “disown himself.” (Mark 8:34) What does that
mean? It means that you put obedience to Jehovah
?rst in your life. What Jehovah wants is more important than your own desires and goals.—Read 1 Peter
4:2.
14

DON’T BE AFRAID OF FAILURE

promise to serve him. They don’t want to disappoint

Jehovah, or they may reason that if they are not dedicated to him, then Jehovah won’t hold them responsible for what they do.
18 Your love for Jehovah will help you to overcome
any fear of disappointing him. Because you love him,
you will do your best to keep your promise to him.
(Ecclesiastes 5:4; Colossians 1:10) You will not think
that it’s too hard to do Jehovah’s will. The apostle
John wrote: “This is what the love of God means, that
we observe his commandments; and yet his commandments are not burdensome.”—1 John 5:3.
19 You don’t have to be perfect to dedicate yourself
to Jehovah. He never expects us to do more than we
can do. (Psalm 103:14) He will help you to do what is
right. (Isaiah 41:10) Trust in Jehovah with all your
heart, and “he will make your paths straight.”—Proverbs 3:5, 6.
PUBLIC DECLARATION FOR SALVATION
Do you think that you’re ready to dedicate yourself to Jehovah? After you have dedicated yourself to
Jehovah, you are ready for the next step. You need to
get baptized.
21 Let the coordinator of the body of elders of your
congregation know that you have dedicated yourself
to Jehovah and that you want to be baptized. Then he

everyone that you have dedicated yourself to Jehovah
and are now one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
WHAT YOUR BAPTISM REPRESENTS
Jesus said that his disciples would be baptized
“in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
the holy spirit.” (Read Matthew 28:19.) What does
that mean? It means that you recognize Jehovah’s authority and Jesus’ role in God’s purpose as well as
how God uses his holy spirit to accomplish his will.
—Psalm 83:18; Matthew 28:18; Galatians 5:22, 23;
2 Peter 1:21.
24 Baptism represents something very important.
When you are immersed in water, it means that you
have died to, or abandoned, your former way of life.
When you come out of the water, you will begin a
new life doing God’s will. It shows that you will serve
Jehovah from now on. Remember that you are not
dedicated to a human, an organization, or a work.
You have dedicated your life to Jehovah.
25 Your dedication will help you to develop a close
friendship with God. (Psalm 25:14) This does not
mean that a person will be saved just because he gets
baptized. The apostle Paul wrote: “Keep working out
your own salvation with fear and trembling.” (Philippians 2:12) Baptism is just the beginning. But how
can you stay close to Jehovah? The last chapter of this
book will answer that question.

CHAPTER NINETEEN

STAY CLOSE TO JEHOVAH
IMAGINE that you are walking outside on a stormy
day. The sky gets darker, lightning starts to ?ash, and
it begins to thunder. Soon the rain pours down. You
search for a place to hide. What a relief when you
?nally ?nd somewhere safe and dry!
2 We are in a similar situation today. World conditions are getting worse. You may wonder, ‘Where can
I ?nd protection?’ The Bible psalmist wrote: “I will
say to Jehovah: ‘You are my refuge and my stronghold, my God in whom I trust.’” (Psalm 91:2) Yes, Jehovah can give us relief from our problems now, and
he gives us a wonderful hope for the future.
3 How can Jehovah protect us? He can help us to
deal with any problem we have, and he is far more
powerful than anyone who may try to harm us. Even
if something bad happens to us now, we can be sure
that Jehovah will repair the damage in the future.
The Bible encourages us: “Keep yourselves in God’s
love.” (Jude 21) We need to stay close to Jehovah to
receive his help during di?cult times. But how can
we do that?
4

RESPOND TO GOD’S LOVE
To stay close to Jehovah, we need to realize just

1, 2. Where can we ?nd protection today?
3. How can we make Jehovah our refuge?
4, 5. How has Jehovah shown his love for us?

198

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

how much he loves us. Think of all that Jehovah has
done for us. He has given us a beautiful earth and
?lled it with fascinating plants and animals. He has
also given us delicious food to eat and clean water
to drink. Through the Bible, Jehovah has taught us
his name and his wonderful qualities. Above all, he
showed his love for us when he sent his beloved Son,
Jesus, to the earth to give his life for us. (John 3:16)
And because of that sacri?ce, we have a wonderful
hope for the future.
5 Jehovah has provided the Messianic Kingdom,
a heavenly government that will soon end all suffering. The Kingdom will make the earth a paradise,
where everyone will live in peace and happiness forever. (Psalm 37:29) Another way Jehovah has shown
his love for us is by teaching us how to live in the best
possible way now. He also invites us to pray to him,
and he is always ready to listen to our prayers. Jehovah has clearly shown his love for every one of us.
6 How should you respond to Jehovah’s love?
Show him that you are thankful for all that he has
done for you. Unfortunately, many today are ungrateful. The same was true when Jesus was on earth. On
one occasion, Jesus healed ten lepers, but only one
thanked him. (Luke 17:12-17) We want to be like the
man who thanked Jesus. We always want to be thankful to Jehovah.
7 We also need to show our love for Jehovah. Jesus
told his disciples that they must love Jehovah with

7. How deeply should we love Jehovah?

STAY CLOSE TO JEHOVAH

199

their whole heart, their whole soul, and their whole
mind. (Read Matthew 22:37.) What does that mean?
8 Is it enough just to say that we love Jehovah?
No. If we love Jehovah with our whole heart, soul,
and mind, we will show our love for him by our
actions. (Matthew 7:16-20) The Bible clearly teaches
that if we love God, we will obey his commandments.
Is that di?cult? No, because Jehovah’s “commandments are not burdensome.”—Read 1 John 5:3.
9 When we obey Jehovah, we have a happy and satisfying life. (Isaiah 48:17, 18) But what will help us to
stay close to Jehovah? Let us see.
CONTINUE DRAWING CLOSER TO JEHOVAH
How did you become Jehovah’s friend? Through
your study of the Bible, you came to know Jehovah more and developed a friendship with him. This
friendship is like a ?re that you want to keep burning.
Just as a ?re needs fuel to burn, you need to continue learning about Jehovah to keep your friendship
strong.—Proverbs 2:1-5.
11 As you continue to study the Bible, you will
learn things that really touch your heart. Notice how
two of Jesus’ disciples felt as Jesus was explaining
Bible prophecies to them. They said: “Were not our
hearts burning within us as he was speaking to us on
the road, as he was fully opening up the Scriptures to
us?”—Luke 24:32.

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

12

Just as the disciples’ hearts were touched when
they understood the Scriptures, you may have felt the
same enthusiasm when you began to understand the
Bible. This helped you to know Jehovah and to love
him. You do not want this love to grow cold.—Matthew 24:12.
13 Once you become a friend of God, you need to
work hard to keep your friendship strong. You must
continue to learn about him and Jesus and to think
about what you are learning and how you can apply
it in your life. (John 17:3) When you read or study the
Bible, ask yourself: ‘What does this teach me about
Jehovah God? Why should I love him with my whole
heart and soul?’—1 Timothy 4:15.
12, 13. (a) What could happen to our love for God? (b) How can
we keep our love for Jehovah alive?

Like a ?re, your love for Jehovah
needs fuel in order to keep burning

STAY CLOSE TO JEHOVAH

201

14

When you have a good friend, you talk to him
regularly, and this keeps your friendship strong. In
the same way, when we talk to Jehovah regularly in
prayer, it keeps our love for him strong. (Read 1 Thessalonians 5:17.) Prayer is a wonderful gift from our
heavenly Father. We should always speak to him
from our heart. (Psalm 62:8) We should not repeat
our prayers from memory, but we should really mean
what we say. Yes, if we continue to study the Bible
and pray from our heart, we will keep our love for Jehovah strong.
TALKING TO OTHERS ABOUT JEHOVAH
If we want to remain close to Jehovah, we also
need to talk to others about our faith. Talking to
others about Jehovah is a wonderful privilege. (Luke
1:74) And it’s a responsibility that Jesus gave to all
true Christians. Each of us should preach the good
news of God’s Kingdom. Have you already done this?
—Matthew 24:14; 28:19, 20.
16 The apostle Paul felt that the preaching work
was very precious; he called it a “treasure.” (2 Corinthians 4:7) Telling others about Jehovah and his purpose is the most important work that you can do. It’s
a way for you to serve Jehovah, and he values what
you do for him. (Hebrews 6:10) Preaching can also
bene?t both you and those who listen to you because
you help others and yourself to draw close to Jehovah and to get everlasting life. (Read 1 Corinthians

15, 16. How do you view the preaching work?

202

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

15:58.) Is there any other work that could give you
more satisfaction?
17 The preaching work is very urgent. We should
“preach the word,” and we should “be at it urgently.” (2 Timothy 4:2) People need to hear about God’s
Kingdom. The Bible says: “The great day of Jehovah is
near! It is near and it is approaching very quickly!”
The end “will not be late!” (Zephaniah 1:14; Habakkuk 2:3) Yes, very soon, Jehovah will destroy Satan’s
wicked world. Before that happens, people need to be
warned so that they can choose to serve Jehovah.
18 Jehovah wants us to worship him along with
other true Christians. The Bible says: “Let us consider
one another so as to incite to love and ?ne works, not
forsaking our meeting together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more
so as you see the day drawing near.” (Hebrews 10:24,
25) We should do our best to be at all the meetings.
The meetings give us an opportunity to encourage
and strengthen one another.
19 When you attend meetings, you’ll ?nd good
friends who will help you to worship Jehovah. You’ll
meet a variety of brothers and sisters who, like you,
do their best to worship him. And like you, they’re
imperfect and make mistakes. When they do, be
ready to forgive them. (Read Colossians 3:13.) Always focus on the good qualities of your Christian

203

brothers and sisters, for doing that will help you to
love them and draw ever closer to Jehovah.
THE REAL LIFE
Jehovah wants all his friends to have the best life
possible. The Bible teaches us that our life in the future will be completely di?erent from our life today.
21 In the future, we will live forever, not just for 70
or 80 years. We will enjoy “everlasting life” in perfect
health, peace, and happiness in a beautiful paradise.
That is what the Bible calls “the real life.” Jehovah
promises to give us this real life, but we must do all
we can now to get a “?rm hold” on it.—1 Timothy 6:
12, 19.
22 How can we “get a ?rm hold on the real life”?
We must “work at good” and “be rich in ?ne works.”
(1 Timothy 6:18) This means that we need to apply
what we learn from the Bible. However, the real life
does not depend on our own e?orts. We can never earn eternal life. It’s a free gift from Jehovah to
his faithful servants, an example of his “undeserved
kindness.” (Romans 5:15) Our heavenly Father really
wants to give his faithful servants this gift.
23 Ask yourself, ‘Am I worshipping God the way he
approves?’ If you ?nd that you need to make some
changes, you should do so right away. When we rely
on Jehovah and do everything we can to obey him,
Jehovah will be our refuge. He will keep his faithful

people safe during the last days of Satan’s wicked

JEHOVAH
God’s name is Jehovah and is understood to mean “He
Causes to Become.” Jehovah is the almighty God, and he
created everything. He has the power to do anything he
decides to do.
In Hebrew, God’s name was written with four letters. In
English, these are represented by YHWH or JHVH. God’s
name appears in the original Hebrew text of the Bible
nearly 7,000 times. People all over the world use di?erent
forms of the name Jehovah, pronouncing it in the way
that is common in their language.
* Chap. 1, par. 15

THE BIBLE IS “INSPIRED OF GOD”
2 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The Author of the Bible is God, but he used men to write
it. This is similar to a businessman telling his secretary to
write a letter that contains his ideas. God used his holy
spirit to guide the Bible writers to record his thoughts.
God’s spirit guided them in various ways, sometimes
causing them to see visions or have dreams that they
would then write down.
* Chap. 2, par. 5

PRINCIPLES
3 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
These are teachings in the Bible that explain a basic truth.
For example, the principle “bad associations spoil useful
habits” teaches us that we are a?ected for good or for bad
by the people with whom we associate. (1 Corinthians
15:33) And the principle “whatever a person is sowing,
this he will also reap” teaches us that we cannot escape
the results of our actions.—Galatians 6:7.

JEHOVAH’S PURPOSE FOR THE EARTH
6 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Satan is the angel who started the rebellion against God.
He is called Satan, which means “Resister,” because he
?ghts against Jehovah. He is also called Devil, which
means “Slanderer.” This name was given to him because
he tells lies about God and deceives people.

ANGELS
Jehovah created the angels long before he created the
earth. They were created to live in heaven. There are
more than a hundred million angels. (Daniel 7:10)
They have names and di?erent personalities, and loyal
angels humbly refuse to be worshipped by humans. They
have di?erent ranks and are assigned a variety of work.
Some of this work includes serving before Jehovah’s
throne, delivering his messages, protecting and guiding
his servants on earth, carrying out his judgments, and
supporting the preaching work. (Psalm 34:7; Revelation
14:6; 22:8, 9) In the future, they will ?ght alongside
Jesus in the war of Armageddon.—Revelation 16:14, 16;
19:14, 15.
* Chap. 3, par. 5; Chap. 10, par. 1

SIN
9 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Anything that we feel, think, or do that is against Jehovah
or his will is sin. Because sin damages our relationship
with God, he has given us laws and principles that help
us to avoid intentional sin. In the beginning, Jehovah
created everything perfect, but when Adam and Eve
chose to disobey Jehovah, they sinned and were no
longer perfect. They grew old and died, and because we
inherited sin from Adam, we too grow old and die.

THE PROPHECY OF THE 70 WEEKS
13 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The Bible prophesied, or foretold, when the Messiah
would appear. This would be at the end of a period
of time called the 69 weeks, which began in the year
455 B.C.E. and ended in the year 29 C.E.
How do we know that it ended in 29 C.E.? The 69 weeks
began in the year 455 B.C.E. when Nehemiah arrived in
Jerusalem and began to rebuild the city. (Daniel 9:25;
Nehemiah 2:1, 5-8) Just as the word “dozen” makes us
think of the number 12, so the word “week” reminds us of
the number 7. The weeks in this prophecy are not weeks
of seven days but are weeks of seven years, in line with
the prophetic rule of “a day for a year.” (Numbers 14:34;
Ezekiel 4:6) This means that each week is seven years long
and that the 69 weeks add up to 483 years (69 x 7). If we
count 483 years from 455 B.C.E., it takes us to the year
29 C.E. This is exactly the year when Jesus was baptized
and became the Messiah!—Luke 3:1, 2, 21, 22.

212

The same prophecy foretold another week, which is an
extra seven years. During this time period, in the year
33 C.E., the Messiah would be killed, and beginning in
the year 36 C.E., the good news of God’s Kingdom would
be preached to all the nations and not just to the Jews.

THE FALSE TEACHING OF THE TRINITY
The Bible teaches that Jehovah God is the Creator and
that he created Jesus before all other things. (Colossians
1:15, 16) Jesus is not Almighty God. He never claimed
that he was equal to God. In fact, he said: “The Father is
greater than I am.” (John 14:28; 1 Corinthians 15:28) But
some religions teach the Trinity, that God is three persons
in one: the Father, the Son, and the holy spirit. The word
“Trinity” is not in the Bible. This is a false teaching.
The holy spirit is God’s active force, his invisible power in
action that he uses to do his will. It is not a person. For
example, early Christians “became filled with holy spirit,”
and Jehovah said: “I will pour out some of my spirit on
every sort of ?esh.”—Acts 2:1-4, 17.
* Chap. 4, par. 12; Chap. 15, par. 17

THE CROSS
15 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
When true Christians worship God, they do not use the
cross. Why not?
(1) The cross has been used in false religion for a long
time. In ancient times it was used in nature worship and
in pagan sex rites. During the ?rst 300 years after Jesus’
death, Christians did not use the cross in their worship.
Much later, Roman Emperor Constantine made the
cross a symbol of Christianity. The symbol was used
to try to make Christianity more popular. But the cross
had nothing to do with Jesus Christ. The New Catholic
Encyclopedia explains: “The cross is found in both
pre-Christian and non-Christian cultures.”
(2) Jesus did not die on a cross. The Greek words
translated “cross” basically mean “an upright stake,”
“a timber,” or “a tree.” The Companion Bible explains:
“There is nothing in the Greek of the [New Testament]

214

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

even to imply two pieces of timber.” Jesus died on an
upright stake.
(3) Jehovah does not want us to use images or symbols
in our worship.—Exodus 20:4, 5; 1 Corinthians 10:14.
* Chap. 5, par. 12

16 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
THE MEMORIAL
Jesus commanded his disciples to observe the Memorial
of his death. They do this each year on Nisan 14, the same
date that the Israelites celebrated the Passover. Bread
and wine, which represent Jesus’ body and blood, are
passed around to everyone at the Memorial. Those who
will rule with Jesus in heaven eat the bread and drink the
wine. Those who have the hope of living forever on earth
respectfully attend the Memorial but do not eat the bread
or drink the wine.
* Chap. 5, par. 21

SOUL

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

In the English edition of the New World Translation, the
word “soul” is used to describe (1) a person, (2) an
animal, or (3) the life of a person or an animal. Here are
some examples:
A person. “In Noah’s day . . . a few people, that is, eight
souls, were carried safely through the water.” (1 Peter 3:
20) Here the word “souls” refers to people—Noah and his
wife, their three sons, and the sons’ wives.
An animal. “God said: ‘Let the waters swarm with living
creatures [“souls,” footnote], and let ?ying creatures
?y above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.’
Then God said: ‘Let the earth bring forth living creatures
[“souls,” footnote] according to their kinds, domestic
animals and creeping animals and wild animals of the

ENDNOTES

215

earth according to their kinds.’ And it was so.”—Genesis
1:20, 24.
The life of a person or an animal. Jehovah told Moses:
“All the men who were seeking to kill you [“seeking your
soul,” footnote] are dead.” (Exodus 4:19) When Jesus
was on earth, he said: “I am the ?ne shepherd; the ?ne
shepherd surrenders his life [“soul,” footnote] in behalf of
the sheep.”—John 10:11.
In addition, when a person does something with his
“whole soul,” this means that he does it willingly and to
the best of his ability. (Matthew 22:37; Deuteronomy 6:5)
The word “soul” can also be used to describe the desire or
appetite of a living creature. A dead person or a dead
body can be referred to as a dead soul.—Numbers 6:6;
Proverbs 23:2; Isaiah 56:11; Haggai 2:13.
* Chap. 6, par. 5; Chap. 15, par. 17

SPIRIT
18 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The Hebrew and Greek words translated “spirit” in the
English edition of the New World Translation can mean
di?erent things. Yet they always refer to something
invisible to humans, such as the wind or the breath
of humans and animals. These words may also refer to
spirit persons and to the holy spirit, which is God’s active
force. The Bible does not teach that a separate part of a
person keeps on living after he dies.—Exodus 35:21; Psalm
104:29; Matthew 12:43; Luke 11:13.
* Chap. 6, par. 5; Chap. 15, par. 17

19 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
GEHENNA
Gehenna is the name of a valley near Jerusalem where
garbage was burned and destroyed. There is no evidence
that in Jesus’ time animals or humans were tortured
or burned alive in this valley. So Gehenna does not

216

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

symbolize an invisible place where people who have died
are tortured and burned forever. When Jesus spoke of
those who are thrown into Gehenna, he was talking about
complete destruction.—Matthew 5:22; 10:28.
* Chap. 7, par. 20

THE LORD’S PRAYER
20 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This is the prayer Jesus gave when teaching his disciples
how to pray. It is also called the Our Father prayer or the
model prayer. For example, Jesus taught us to pray this
way:
“Let your name be sancti?ed”
We pray for Jehovah to clear his name, or reputation, of all
lies. This is so that everyone in heaven and on earth will
honor and respect God’s name.
“Let your Kingdom come”
We pray for God’s government to destroy Satan’s wicked
world, to rule over the earth, and to make the earth into a
paradise.
“Let your will take place . . . on earth”
We pray for God’s purpose for the earth to be ful?lled so
that obedient, perfect humans can live forever in Paradise,
just as Jehovah wanted when humans were created.
* Chap. 8, par. 2

21 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
THE RANSOM
Jehovah provided the ransom to save humans from sin
and death. The ransom was the price needed to buy back
the perfect human life that the ?rst man, Adam, lost and
to repair man’s damaged relationship with Jehovah. God
sent Jesus to earth so that he could die for all sinners.
Because of Jesus’ death, all humans have the opportunity
to live forever and become perfect.
* Chap. 8, par. 21; Chap. 9, par. 13

WHY IS THE YEAR 1914 SO IMPORTANT?
The prophecy in Daniel chapter 4 teaches us that God
would set up his Kingdom in 1914.
The prophecy: Jehovah gave King Nebuchadnezzar a
prophetic dream about a large tree that was chopped
down. In the dream, a band of iron and copper was put
around the tree’s stump to stop it from growing for a
period of “seven times.” After that, the tree would grow
again.—Daniel 4:1, 10-16.
What the prophecy means for us: The tree represents
God’s rulership. For many years, Jehovah used kings in
Jerusalem to rule over the nation of Israel. (1 Chronicles
29:23) But those kings became unfaithful, and their
rulership ended. Jerusalem was destroyed in the year
607 B.C.E. That was the start of the “seven times.”
(2 Kings 25:1, 8-10; Ezekiel 21:25-27) When Jesus said,
“Jerusalem will be trampled on by the nations until the
appointed times of the nations are ful?lled,” he was
talking about the “seven times.” (Luke 21:24) So the
“seven times” did not end when Jesus was on earth.
Jehovah promised to appoint a King at the end of the
“seven times.” The rulership of this new King, Jesus,
would bring great blessings for God’s people all over the
earth, forever.—Luke 1:30-33.
The length of the “seven times”: The “seven times”
lasted for 2,520 years. If we count 2,520 years from the
year 607 B.C.E., we end up at the year 1914. That was
when Jehovah made Jesus, the Messiah, King of God’s
Kingdom in heaven.

WHAT CAN THE BIBLE TEACH US?

How do we get the number 2,520? The Bible says that
three and a half times equal 1,260 days. (Revelation 12:
6, 14) So “seven times” is double that number, or 2,520
days. The 2,520 days are equal to 2,520 years because of
the prophetic rule “a day for a year.”—Numbers 14:34;
Ezekiel 4:6.
* Chap. 8, par. 23

23 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL
The word “archangel” means “chief of the angels.” The
Bible mentions only one archangel, and his name is
Michael.—Daniel 12:1; Jude 9.
Michael is the Leader of God’s army of faithful angels.
Revelation 12:7 says: “Michael and his angels battled with
the dragon . . . and its angels.” The book of Revelation
says that the Leader of God’s army is Jesus, so Michael is
another name for Jesus.—Revelation 19:14-16.
* Chap. 9, par. 4

24 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
THE LAST DAYS
This expression refers to the time period when major
events would happen on earth just before God’s
Kingdom destroys Satan’s world. Similar expressions,
such as “the conclusion of the system of things” and “the
presence of the Son of man,” are used in Bible prophecy
to refer to the same time period. (Matthew 24:3, 27,
37) “The last days” started when God’s Kingdom began
ruling in heaven in 1914 and will end when Satan’s world
is destroyed at Armageddon.—2 Timothy 3:1; 2 Peter 3:3.
* Chap. 9, par. 5

25 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
RESURRECTION
When God brings a person who has died back to life, it is
called a resurrection. Nine resurrections are mentioned
in the Bible. Elijah, Elisha, Jesus, Peter, and Paul all
performed resurrections. These miracles were possible
only because of God’s power. Jehovah promises to
resurrect “both the righteous and the unrighteous” to
life on earth. (Acts 24:15) The Bible also mentions a
resurrection to heaven. This takes place when those who
are chosen, or anointed, by God are resurrected to live in
heaven with Jesus.—John 5:28, 29; 11:25; Philippians 3:11;
Revelation 20:5, 6.
* Chap. 9, par. 13

26 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
DEMONISM (SPIRITISM)
Demonism or spiritism is the bad practice of trying to
communicate with spirits, either directly or through
someone else, such as a witch doctor, a medium, or a
psychic. People who practice spiritism do this because
they believe the false teaching that spirits of humans
survive death and become powerful ghosts. The demons
also try to in?uence humans to disobey God. Astrology,
divination, magic, witchcraft, superstitions, the occult,
and the supernatural are also part of demonism. Many
books, magazines, horoscopes, movies, posters, and even
songs make the demons, magic, and the supernatural
seem harmless or exciting. Many funeral customs, such
as sacri?ces for the dead, funeral celebrations, funeral
anniversaries, widowhood rites, and some wake rituals,
also include contact with the demons. People often use
drugs when trying to use the power of the demons.

27 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
JEHOVAH’S SOVEREIGNTY
Jehovah is Almighty God, and he created the whole
universe. (Revelation 15:3) That is why he is the Owner
of all things and has sovereignty, or complete authority,
to rule over his creation. (Psalm 24:1; Isaiah 40:21-23;
Revelation 4:11) He has made laws for everything that he
has created. Jehovah also has the authority to appoint
others to be rulers. We support God’s sovereignty when
we love him and obey him.—1 Chronicles 29:11.
* Chap. 11, par. 10

ABORTION
28 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
An abortion is done intentionally to cause the death of an
unborn child. It is not an accident or the result of a natural
reaction of the human body. From the time of conception,
a child is not just another part of the mother’s body. The
child is a separate person.

BLOOD TRANSFUSION
This is the medical procedure in which whole blood or
one of its four main components is transferred into a

plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

30 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
DISCIPLINE
In the Bible, the word for “discipline” is not just another
word for punishment. When we are disciplined, we are
instructed, educated, and corrected. Jehovah is never
abusive or cruel to those he disciplines. (Proverbs 4:
1, 2) Jehovah sets a beautiful example for parents. The
discipline he gives is so e?ective that a person can actually
come to love discipline. (Proverbs 12:1) Jehovah loves his
people, and he trains them. He gives them instruction
that corrects wrong ideas and that helps them to learn
to think and act in a way that pleases him. For parents,
discipline includes helping their children to understand
the reasons why they should be obedient. It also means
teaching them to love Jehovah, as well as to love his Word,
the Bible, and to understand its principles.
* Chap. 14, par. 13

31 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
DEMONS
They are invisible, wicked spirit creatures with
superhuman powers. The demons are wicked angels.
They became wicked when they made themselves
enemies of God by disobeying him. (Genesis 6:2; Jude 6)
They joined Satan’s rebellion against Jehovah.
