Wise King Solomon wrote: “Rejoice,
young man [or woman], in your youth, and
let your heart do you good in the days of your
young manhood, and walk in the ways of your
heart and in the things seen by your eyes.”
(Ecclesiastes 11:9) When you are young, life
can be so interesting and exciting, and we want
you to enjoy it. However, we encourage you to do
so in a way that pleases Jehovah God. Never
forget that he can see what you are doing with

it is, then, to follow Solomon’s further advice:

A Note to Parents
To young people, going through adolescence can be
like walking a tightrope. Each step may seem uncertain
—even frightening. As a parent, you may sometimes
wish you could spare your young ones this particular
“walk.” You can’t, of course, but you can be their balancing pole. You are in a unique position to help your
children stay on course and emerge from their adolescence as responsible adults.
Easier said than done? Certainly. It may seem like
only yesterday that your son was an energetic toddler
who wouldn’t keep quiet; now he’s a withdrawn teen who
won’t talk to you. Not long ago your little girl wanted to
go everywhere with you; now she seems morti?ed at the
very idea of being seen in public with her parents!
Yet, you need not feel inadequate when facing these
changes. You have access to a source of wisdom that can
provide solid guidance for you and your child. That
source of wisdom is God’s Word, the Bible.
Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work,
Volume 2, is designed to provide your child with solid
reasoning from the Scriptures. A look at Contents on
pages 4 and 5 will give you an idea of the variety of topics
covered. But this publication will do more than present
the facts. Consider the following:
(1) The book is interactive. In many places your
child will be prompted to write down his or her response
to various questions and statements. For example, the
“Peer-Pressure Planner” on pages 132 and 133 will help
your child think about speci?c challenges he or she faces
and ways to respond to them. In addition, each of this
2 young people ask

book’s nine sections concludes with a page entitled “My
Journal,” in which your child can write personal thoughts
and feelings on the material contained in that section.
(2) The book promotes communication. For example,
pages 63 and 64 contain the box “How Can I Talk to Dad
or Mom About Sex?” Also, at the end of each chapter,
there is a box entitled “What Do You Think?” More than
a review, this box can be used as an outline for family discussion. In addition, each chapter contains an “Action
Plan!” the last segment of which asks the young person
to complete this sentence: “What I would like to ask my
parent(s) about this subject is . . .” This will encourage
youths to look to their parents for balanced advice as
they walk the tightrope of adolescence.
A word of caution: To encourage your adolescents to
write in their book with candor, allow them a measure of
privacy. Later they may well open up to you on the issues
they have written about.
Obtain your own copy of this book, and become thoroughly familiar with it. As you read, try to recall all the
drama, confusion, and anxiety that were part of your own
adolescence. When appropriate, share your experiences
with your son or daughter. That will encourage your
young ones to con?de in you. When they talk, listen!
If e?orts to communicate seem futile, do not give up. No
matter how much they may indicate otherwise, children
tend to value the advice of their parents more than that
of their peers.
It is our pleasure to provide both you and your children with this Bible-based tool, and it is our prayer that it
will prove to be a blessing to your family.

PREFACE

Where can I find the

best advice?
for girls
You can’t help but think about the gorgeous new boy
in class. ‘He doesn’t even know I exist,’ you tell yourself, ‘so, what harm is there in daydreaming?’ Besides,
it’s not just you. This boy is every girl’s dream. You
know that because you hear the other girls talking
about him all the time.
Suddenly he’s looking in your direction. He catches
you o? guard with his disarming smile. You smile back.
He approaches.
“Hi,” he says shyly.
“Hey,” you say back.
“I’m Brett.”

for boys
Two of your schoolmates are approaching. You feel a
knot in your stomach because twice already this week
they’ve tried to get you to smoke. This will be their
third attempt.
The ?rst boy speaks: “All alone again? Let me
introduce you to a friend.” He underscores the word
“friend” with a wink as he takes something out of his
pocket and extends his hand toward you.
You see something between the boy’s thumb and
fore?nger that resembles a cigarette. You know exactly
what it is, and the knot in your stomach gets even
tighter.
Preface 7

“You’re new here,” you blurt out.
“My family just moved in a few weeks ago.”
You still can’t believe that Brett is actually talking to
you!
“Look,” Brett continues, “I’m having a party at my
house after school today. Want to come?”
Then he leans forward and winks.
“Let me warn you,” he says. “My parents aren’t home,
and the liquor cabinet isn’t locked. What do you say?”
Brett is waiting for your reply. Any other girl in your
school would say yes immediately!
What will you say?

“Sorry,” you say. “I’ve already told you I don’t . . .”
The second boy interrupts: “It’s that religion of yours,
isn’t it? You can’t have any fun!”
“Or are you just chicken?” the ?rst boy taunts.
“No, I’m not chicken!” you summon the courage to
say.
Then the second boy places his arm around your
shoulder. “Just take it,” he says softly.
The ?rst boy moves the white object closer to your
face and adds in a hushed voice: “We won’t tell anyone.
No one will ever know.”
What will you do?

SIMILAR scenes are played out every day in virtually
every part of the globe. The fact is, though, that some
young people are better prepared than others to handle
such situations. In the pressure of the moment, a boy
being tempted to smoke might think: ‘I don’t want to give
in, but I can’t take any more pressure. Why can’t I show
my schoolmates that I can be “normal”?’ Or a girl who’s
asked out on a date might say to herself: ‘He’s clean-cut.
For once—just this once—why can’t I say yes?’
On the other hand, many youths have been trained to
stand up con?dently for what they believe. As a result
—strange as it may seem—they feel less pressure to do
wrong. Would you like to be that kind of youth? The good
news is that you can be! How?
The Bible can help you to face the challenges of youth
with con?dence. It contains the best advice to be found
because it’s the inspired Word of God. (2 Timothy 3:16,
17) What types of issues can the Bible help you with?
Look at the list below, and put a  next to the topics that
particularly appeal to you.
i O Relating to the opposite sex
O Coming to terms with my body
O Making friends
O Surviving school
O Managing my money
O Dealing with my parents
O Controlling my feelings
O Exploring my recreation options
O Improving my spirituality

As you will note on pages 4 and 5, the topics listed above correspond to the nine sections of this book.
Which ones did you mark? You might want to consult
Preface 9

those sections ?rst. Bible principles can help you in each
of these areas of life. The book you’re now reading will
show you how.1
This book will also provide you with opportunities to express your thoughts. For example, near the
end of each chapter, you’ll ?nd a box entitled “Action
Plan!” There you will be asked to record your thoughts
on how you can apply what you’ve read. Worksheets
—such as the “Peer-Pressure Planner” on pages 132
and 133—will help you to think through the challenges
you face and to create practical solutions. In addition,
each section of this book concludes with a page entitled
“My Journal,” which will allow you to write about how a
particular aspect of the material applies to your life. You
will also ?nd at points throughout the book nine pages
entitled “Role Model.” In these, various Bible characters
are highlighted as being worthy of imitation.
The Bible urges you: “Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding.” (Proverbs 4:5) The words “wisdom” and
“understanding” imply more than simply knowing right
from wrong. You need to see the big picture. For example, knowing the consequences of a wrong course as well
as the rewards for doing what is right will help you to face
up to peer pressure with con?dence and courage.
Be assured of this: Your problems—overwhelming as
they may seem—are not unique. Others have faced and
successfully dealt with challenges like yours. You can too!
Make good use of Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work, Volume 2. It will convince you that the
Bible contains the best advice to be found anywhere!

You see a boy and girl

corridor between classes.

Boy and girl, girl and boy. They’re everywhere
you look—in school, on the street, at the mall.
Each time you see them, you feel a powerful urge to
be part of that unit called a couple. But are you
ready to date? If you are, how can you ?nd someone
who’s right for you? If you do ?nd someone, how
can you keep the relationship clean while dating?
Chapters 1-5 will help you answer those questions.

Am I ready to date?
“There’s a ton of pressure all around me to
date. There’s also a ton of cute guys.”—Whitney.
“Some girls come on strong, and I want to say
yes. But if I ask my parents, I know what their
answer will be.”—Phillip.

THE urge to be with someone special—and to be with
someone who thinks you are special—can be incredibly
strong, even at a very young age. “I started to feel the pressure to date when I was 11,” recalls Jenifer. Brittany says:
“At school you feel like you’re only half a person if you’re
not dating someone—anyone!”
What about you? Are you ready to date? To answer
that, we ?rst need to address a more basic question:
14 young people ask

What Is “Dating”?
Mark your response to the following questions:

i
You regularly go out with a certain member O Yes
of the opposite sex. Are you dating? O No
You and a member of the opposite sex
are attracted to each other. Several times
a day, you text-message or talk to this O Yes
person on the phone. Are you dating? O No
Every time you get together with your
friends, you pair o? with the same person O Yes
of the opposite sex. Are you dating? O No

You most likely had no problem answering the ?rst
question. But you may have paused before responding to
the second and the third. What exactly is dating? Really,
dating is any social activity in which your romantic interest
is focused on one particular person and that person’s interest is focused on you. So the answer to all three questions
listed above is yes. Whether on the phone or face-to-face,
in the open or in secret, if you and a friend of the opposite
sex have a special romantic understanding and communicate regularly, it’s dating. Are you ready to go down that
road? A consideration of three questions will help you ?nd
out.
Why Do You Want to Date?
In many cultures dating is regarded as a legitimate way
for two people to become better acquainted. But dating
should have an honorable purpose—to help a young man
and woman determine if they want to get married to each
other.
Granted, some of your peers might take a casual view
of dating. Perhaps they simply enjoy being with a special friend of the opposite sex, without any intention of
Am I ready to date? 15

If you date with no intention of
marriage, you are acting like a child
who plays with a new toy and then
discards it

marriage. Some might even view
such a friend as little more than a
trophy or an accessory to be seen
with in public to boost their own
self-esteem. Often, though, such
shallow relationships are shortlived. “Many young ones who date
break up with each other a week or
two later,” says a girl named Heather. “They come to view
relationships as transitory—which in a sense prepares
them for divorce rather than for marriage.”
Clearly, when you date someone, you’re a?ecting that
person’s feelings. So be sure your intentions are honorable.
Think: Would you like someone to play with your feelings
as if they were some child’s toy—to be picked up for a moment and then quickly abandoned? A youth named Chelsea says: “Part of me wants to say that dating should be
just for fun, but it’s no fun when one person is taking it seriously and the other isn’t.”
You’re How Old?

start dating? i ............

they’re old enough to know themselves better.
That’s what Danielle, 17, decided to do. She
says: “Thinking back to two years ago, what
I would have looked for in a potential mate
was so di?erent from what I would look
for now. Basically, even at this point I
don’t trust myself to make such a decision. When I feel that my personality has
been stable for a couple of years, then I’ll
think about dating.”
There’s another reason why waiting is
wise. The Bible uses the phrase “the bloom
of youth” to describe the period of life when
sexual feelings and romantic emotions ?rst become
strong. (1 Corinthians 7:36) To maintain close association with one particular member of the opposite sex while
you’re still in this phase can

that kind of thinking! (Romans

you to “?ee from sexual immorality.” (1 Corinthians 6:18, New International Version)
By waiting until you’re past the bloom of youth, you can

look at yourself. Consider the following:

Relationships. How do you treat your parents and siblings? Do you often lose your self-control with them, perhaps using harsh or sarcastic language to make a point?
What would they say about you in that regard? How you
deal with family members indicates how you will treat a
mate.—Read Ephesians 4:31.
Demeanor. Are you positive or pessimistic? Are you
reasonable, or do you always insist on doing things a certain way—your way? Can you keep calm when under pressure? Are you patient? Cultivating the fruitage of God’s
spirit now will help you prepare for being a husband or a
wife later.—Read Galatians 5:22, 23.
Finances. How well do you handle money? Are you often in debt? Can you hold down a job? If not, why not? Is it
because of the job? the employer? Or is it because of some
habit or trait that you need to work on? If you have trouble

The person you marry deserves nothing less than a spiritually strong partner.—Read Ecclesiastes 4:9, 10.
What You Can Do
Being pressured to date before you’re ready would be
like being forced to take a ?nal exam for a course that
you’ve barely started. Obviously, that wouldn’t be fair! You
need time to study your subject so you can become familiar
with the kind of problems you’ll face in the test.
It’s similar with dating. As we’ve seen, dating is no trivial matter. So before you’re ready to focus on one particular person, you need to take time to study a very important
“subject”—how to build friendships. Later, when you meet
the right person, you’ll be in a better position to build a solid

relationship. After all, a good marriage is the union of two
good friends.
Waiting to date won’t sti?e your freedom. On the contrary, it will give you more freedom to ‘rejoice in your
youth.’ (Ecclesiastes 11:9) And you’ll have time to prepare
yourself by developing your personality and, most important, your spirituality.—Lamentations 3:27.
In the meantime, you can enjoy the company of the opposite sex. What’s the best way to do so? Associate together in properly supervised mixed groups. A girl named Tammy says: “I think it’s more fun that way. It’s better to have a
lot of friends.” Monica agrees. “The group idea is a really
good idea,” she says, “because you get to see people with
di?erent personalities.”
In contrast, if you focus on one person too soon, you set
yourself up for heartache. So take your time. Use this period of your life to learn how to cultivate and maintain friendships. Later, if you choose to date, you’ll have a better idea
of who you are and what you need in a lifelong partner.
Tempted to date behind your
parents’ backs? There are more pitfalls to the practice
than you may realize.

Secret dating
—what’s the harm?
Jessica was caught in a dilemma. It all started
when a classmate named Jeremy began showing
interest in her. “He was very cute,” she says,
“and my friends said he was the most decent boy
I’d ever meet. Several girls had tried to start a
relationship with him, but he wasn’t interested
in them. He liked only me.”
Before long, Jeremy asked Jessica out. Jessica
explained that as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
she wouldn’t be allowed to date someone who
wasn’t of her faith. “But then Jeremy had an
idea,” she says. “He asked, ‘Why can’t we just
date behind your parents’ backs?’ ”

IF SOMEONE you were attracted to
made such a suggestion, how would
you respond? You might be surprised to learn that Jessica agreed
to Jeremy’s plan. “I was convinced
that if I dated him, I could make
him learn to love Jehovah,” she says.
How did things turn out? We’ll ?nd
out later. First, let’s see how some get
caught in the snare of secret dating.
Why They Do It
Why do some date secretly?
A young man named David
puts it concisely, “They know

their parents would not approve, so they don’t tell them.”
Jane points out another possibility. “Secret dating is a rebellion thing,” she says. “If you feel that you’re not being
treated like the young adult you think you are, you decide
that you’re going to do what you want and just not tell
your parents.”
Can you think of any other reasons why some might be
tempted to date secretly? If so, list them below.
i .............................................................................
.............................................................................

Of course, you realize that the Bible
commands you to obey your parents.
(Ephesians 6:1) And if your parents object to your dating, they must have a
good reason. Still, don’t be surprised if
you ?nd yourself thinking:
? I feel left out because everyone
is dating except me.
? I’m attracted to someone who
doesn’t share my faith.
? I would like to go out with a
fellow Christian, even though
I’m too young to marry.
You probably know what
your parents would say
about the above statements. And deep down,
you know that your parents are right. At the
same time, you may
feel like a girl named
Manami, who says:

“The pressure to date is so strong that I sometimes doubt

Besides, it’s no fun being by myself!” Some in that situation
have begun to date, hiding the matter from their parents.
How?
“We Were Told to Keep It a Secret”
The very term “secret dating” suggests a measure of
deception, and that’s just what it takes to make it work.
Some keep their dating secret by communicating primarily over the phone or the Internet. In public, they’re just
friends, but their e-mails, phone calls, and text messages
tell a completely di?erent story.
Another sly tactic is to arrange for a group activity, only
to pair o? later. James says: “Once, a group of us were invited to meet at a location, only to discover that the whole
thing had been set up so that two in the group could be together. We were told to keep it a secret.”
Frequently, as James points out, secret dating is carried on with the cooperation of friends. “Often, at least
one friend knows about the situation but chooses not to
say anything because of a ‘don’t-tell’ mentality,” says Carol. At times, blatant dishonesDID YOU KNOW . . .

The Pitfalls of Secret Dating
If you’re tempted to date secretly—or if you’re already
doing so—you need to ask yourself the following two
questions:
Where will my course lead? Do you intend to marry
the person reasonably soon? “Dating without the intention
of marriage is like advertising something you’re not selling,” says 20-year-old Evan. What can result? Proverbs 13:
12 says: “Expectation postponed is making the heart sick.”
Do you really want to make someone you care about sick
at heart? Another caution: Dating secretly will rob you of
the loving interest of your parents and other concerned
adults. Because of this, you’re more likely to fall into the
trap of sexual immorality.—Galatians 6:7.
How does Jehovah God feel about what I’m doing?
The Bible says: “All things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting.” (Hebrews 4:13) So if you’re covering up your
own dating—or that of a friend—Jehovah already knows
about it. And if deception is involved, you have good reason to be concerned. Jehovah God feels strongly about
lying. Indeed, “a false tongue” is listed prominently in
the Bible among the things that he detests!—Proverbs 6:
16-19.
Ending the Secrecy
Certainly, you would do well to talk to your parents or
a mature Christian adult about any secret relationship that
you may be involved in. And if a friend of yours is dating secretly, don’t share in his or her course by helping to cover

it up. (1 Timothy 5:22)
After all, how would
you feel if the relationship had harmful consequences? Wouldn’t
you be at least partly
responsible?
To illustrate: Suppose a friend is diabetic and is secretly ?lling up on sweets. What if you found out about it, but
your friend begged you not to tell anyone? What would be
your greatest concern—covering up for your friend or taking action that could possibly save his or her life?
You face a similar situation if you know that an acquaintance is dating secretly. Don’t worry about permanently ruining your friendship. In time, a true friend will realize that

best interests.—Psalm 141:5.



Secrecy or Privacy?
Of course, not all secrecy
surrounding dating involves
deception. For instance, suppose a young man and woman would like to become better
acquainted, but for a time they
do not wish to make that widely known. Perhaps, as a young

man named Thomas says, “they don’t want to be teased
with questions like, ‘So when are you getting married?’ ”
Undue pressure from others can indeed be harmful.
(Song of Solomon 2:7) Therefore, at the initial stage of a
relationship, some may well choose to be discreet. (Proverbs 10:19) “This gives two people time to decide if they’re
serious about each other,” says 20-year-old Anna. “If they
are, then they can go public.”
At the same time, it would be wrong to hide your relationship from those who have a right to know about it,
such as your parents or the parents of the person you’re
dating. Really, if you can’t be open about your dating, you
should ask yourself why. Do you know in your heart that
your parents would have valid reason to object?

Take a moment to complete the following quiz:
What qualities would you currently view as essential in a potential marriage mate? In the list
below, put a  next to the four traits you feel are
most important.
i O Good-looking
O Spiritually-minded
O Friendly
O Popular
O Funny

O Trustworthy
O Morally upright
O Goal-oriented

When you were younger, did you ever develop a
crush on anyone? In the list above, put an  next
to the one trait you found most appealing about
that person at the time.

THERE’S nothing wrong with any of the above traits. Each
of them has its own appeal. Wouldn’t you agree, though,
that when you’re in the grip of a youthful crush, you tend to
dwell on the more super?cial qualities, such as those in the
left-hand column?
As you mature, however, you begin using your powers
of perception to examine deeper issues, such as those in
the right-hand column. For instance, you start to realize
that the cutest girl in the neighborhood may not be all that
trustworthy or that the most popular boy in class may not
be morally upright. If you’re past the bloom of youth, you
most likely look beyond the super?cial traits to answer the
question, “Is this person right for me?”
Know Yourself First
Before you can consider who might be right for you,
you need to know yourself well. To learn more
about yourself, answer the following questions:
Is this person right for me? 29

What are my strengths?

i ..................................................................................................

What are my weaknesses or vulnerabilities?
..................................................................................................
..................................................................................................

What emotional and spiritual needs do I have?
..................................................................................................
..................................................................................................

Getting to know yourself is no small task, but questions
like those above can get you started. The more you understand yourself, the better equipped you will be to ?nd someone who will amplify your strengths rather than your weaknesses.1 What if you think you’ve found that person?
Will Just Anyone Do?
“Can I get to know you better?” That question will make
you either cringe or leap for joy—depending on who’s asking. Suppose you answer yes. Over the course of time, how
can you tell if your boyfriend or girlfriend is right for you?
Suppose you want to
buy a new pair of shoes. You
go to the store and ?nd a
pair that catches your eye.
You try on the shoes, only

yourself by considering the questions
in Chapter 1 following the subheading

Not just any size shoe will ?t;
similarly, not just anyone

to ?nd that—much to your disappointment—they’re too
tight. What would you do? Buy the shoes anyway? Or look
for a di?erent pair? Clearly, the better choice is to put the
shoes back and look for others. It would make little sense to
walk around in a pair of shoes that just didn’t ?t!
It’s similar with choosing a marriage partner. Over time,
more than a few members of the opposite sex may catch
your eye. But not just anyone will do. After all, you want
someone you’ll be comfortable with—someone who truly
?ts your personality and your goals. (Genesis 2:18; Matthew 19:4-6) Have you found such a person? If so, how can
you tell if that one is right for you?

Looking Beyond the Surface
To answer that last question, look at your friend objectively. Be careful, though! You might be inclined to see only
what you want to see. So take your time. Try to perceive
your friend’s true nature. This will take e?ort on your part.
But that’s only to be expected. To illustrate: Imagine that
you want to purchase a car. How thoroughly would you research it? Would you be concerned only about the outer appearance? Wouldn’t it make sense to look deeper—perhaps learning as much as you could about the condition of
the engine?
Do you think it’s
important to look beyond
outward appearance
when choosing a car?
How much more so when
choosing a marriage mate!

Finding a mate is a much weightier issue than choosing
a car. Yet, many who date don’t look beyond the surface. Instead, they quickly point to the things they have in common:
‘We like the same music.’ ‘We enjoy the same activities.’ ‘We
agree on everything!’ As mentioned earlier, though, if you’re
truly past the bloom of youth, you look beyond super?cial
traits. You see the need to discern “the secret person of the
heart.”—1 Peter 3:4; Ephesians 3:16.
For example, rather than focus on how much you agree
on things, it might be more revealing to note what happens
when you disagree. In other words, how does this person
handle con?ict—by insisting on his or her way, perhaps giving in to “?ts of anger” or “abusive speech”? (Galatians 5:19,
20; Colossians 3:8) Or does this person show reasonableness—a willingness to yield for the sake of peace when no
issue of right or wrong is at stake?—James 3:17.
Another factor to consider: Is the person manipulative, possessive, or jealous? Does he or she demand
to know your every move? “I

ROLE MODEL

The Shulammite
The young Shulammite woman knows she needs
to keep a clear head in matters of romance. “I have put
you under oath,” she tells her companions, “that you try
not to awaken or arouse love in me until it feels inclined.”
The Shulammite knows that feelings can quickly overpower reason. She realizes, for instance, that others could
pressure her to yield to the advances of someone who isn’t
right for her. Even her own feelings could cloud good judgment. So the Shulammite remains like “a wall.”—Song of
Solomon 8:4, 10.
Is your view of love as mature as that of the Shulammite? Can you listen to your head and not just your
heart? (Proverbs 2:10, 11) Sometimes others might try to
pressure you into a relationship before you’re ready for it.
You might even bring such pressure upon yourself. For example, when you see a boy and girl walking hand in hand,
do you feel desperate to have the same kind of relationship? Would you settle for someone who doesn’t share
your Bible-based beliefs? The Shulammite girl was mature
when it came to matters of romance. You can be too!

“do not become unevenly yoked”
“Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers.”
That Bible principle, found at 2 Corinthians 6:14, likely
makes sense to you. Still, you might ?nd yourself drawn
to an unbeliever. Why? Sometimes it’s just physical
attraction. “I would always see this girl in gym class,” says
a boy named Mark. “She would go out of her way to
come up and talk to me. It was not hard for a friendship
to develop.”
If you know yourself and have con?dence in your spiritual values—and if you’re mature enough not to be ruled
by your feelings—you’ll know what you should do. Really,
this person—no matter how attractive, charming, or
seemingly virtuous—will not enhance your friendship with
God.—James 4:4.
Of course, if a romance has developed, ending it
won’t be easy—something that a girl named Cindy found
out. “I cried every day,” she says. “I thought about the boy
constantly, even during Christian meetings. I loved him
so much that I thought I would rather die than lose him.”
Soon, though, Cindy saw the wisdom of her mother’s counsel against dating an unbeliever. “It’s good that I broke up
with him,” she says. “I have every con?dence that Jehovah
will provide for my needs.”
Are you in a situation similar to that of Cindy? If so, you
don’t have to deal with it alone! You could talk to your parents. That’s what Jim did when he found himself infatuated with a girl at school. “I ?nally asked my parents for
help,” he says. “This was a key to my overcoming these
feelings.” Congregation elders can also assist you. Why
not talk to one of them about what you’re going through?

family—especially my father. When I ended the relationship, I felt as if a huge weight had been lifted o? my shoulders!”
Sarah had a similar experience. She began to notice that
John, the young man she was dating, was sarcastic, demanding, and rude. “One time,” Sarah recalls, “he
came to the door three hours late! He ignored
my mother when she answered the door,
and then he said: ‘Let’s go. We’re late.’
Not ‘I’m late,’ but ‘We’re late.’ He should
have apologized or explained himself.
Most of all, he should have shown my
mother respect!” Of course, a single
disappointing act or trait doesn’t necessarily doom a relationship. (Psalm
130:3) But when Sarah realized that
John’s rudeness was a pattern rather
than an isolated incident, she decided to end the relationship.
What if, like Jill and Sarah, you
determine that the person you’re dating
wouldn’t make a suitable marriage partner? In that case, do
not ignore your feelings! Hard as it is to accept, it might be
best to end the relationship. Proverbs 22:3 says: “Shrewd is
the one that has seen the calamity and proceeds to conceal
himself.” If, for example, your friend exhibits one or more of
the danger signs found on pages 39 and 40, it would be best
to end the relationship—at least until the problem is corrected. True, breaking up may not be easy. But marriage is

a permanent bond. It’s better to live with short-term pain
now than su?er with lifelong regret later!

Breaking the News
How should you go about breaking up? First, choose
a proper setting for the discussion. What could that be?
Well, think how you would like to be treated in such a situation. (Matthew 7:12) Would you want the announcement
to be made in front of others? Likely not. Unless circumstances make it advisable, it would be best not to terminate
a relationship by means of a telephone answering
machine, a text message, or an e-mail. Instead,
choose a time and place that will enable you to
discuss this serious matter.
What should you say when the time
comes to speak up? The apostle Paul urged
Christians to “speak truth” with one another.
(Ephesians 4:25) The best course, then, is to
be tactful yet ?rm. State clearly why you feel
that this relationship won’t work for you. You
don’t need to recite a laundry list of faults or let
loose with a barrage of criticism. In fact, instead of saying, “You don’t” do this or “You
never” do that, it would be better to use
phrases that focus on how you feel—“I
need a person who . . .” or “I feel that this
relationship should end because . . .”
This is no time to be wishy-washy or to yield to another’s opinion. Remember, you have chosen to break up for

a serious reason. So be cautious if your friend attempts
to change your mind through subtle forms of manipulation. “After I ended the relationship,” says a young woman
named Lori, “my ex-boyfriend started acting depressed all
the time. I think he did it to make me feel sorry for him. I did
feel bad. But I didn’t allow his reaction to alter my decision.”
Like Lori, know your own mind. Stick to your decision. Let
your no mean no.—James 5:12.

Aftermath of a Breakup
Don’t be surprised if you’re deeply upset for a time after the breakup. You might even feel like the psalmist who
said: “I have become disconcerted, I have bowed low to
an extreme degree; all day long I have walked about sad.”
(Psalm 38:6) Some well-intentioned friends may try to
help by encouraging you to give the relationship another
chance. Be careful! You will have to live with your decision—not your well-meaning friends. So don’t be afraid to

God’s Word helps us to answer the question, “How far is

42 young people ask

? It’s always wrong for two people who are dating to
touch each other, under any circumstances.

False. The Bible doesn’t condemn legitimate, clean expressions of a?ection. For example, the Bible tells the story
of a Shulammite girl and a shepherd boy who were in love.
Their courtship was chaste. Yet, they evidently exchanged
some displays of a?ection before they married. (Song of
Solomon 1:2; 2:6; 8:5) Today some couples who are seriously contemplating marriage may likewise feel that some
chaste expressions of a?ection are appropriate.1
However, a dating couple must exercise extreme caution. Kissing, embracing, or doing anything that causes
arousal can lead to sexual misconduct. It’s all too easy, even
for a couple with honorable intentions, to get carried away
and engage in sexual immorality.—Colossians 3:5.
? A couple who refrain from sexual intercourse can
still be guilty of fornication.

if it’s carried on over

How far is too far? 43

what if we’ve gone too far?
What if you’ve fallen into improper conduct? Don’t
deceive yourself into thinking you can solve the problem
alone. “I’d pray, ‘Help us not to do it again,’ ” confessed
one youth. “Sometimes it would work, but a few times it
didn’t.” Therefore, talk to your parents. The Bible also
gives this good advice: “Call the older men of the
congregation.” (James 5:14) These Christian shepherds
can give counsel, advice, and reproof so that you can get
your relationship with God back on track.

Furthermore, the Bible condemns more than just fornication. The apostle Paul wrote: “The works of the ?esh are
manifest, and they are fornication, uncleanness, loose conduct.” He added: “Those who practice such things will not
inherit God’s kingdom.”—Galatians 5:19-21.
What is “uncleanness”? The Greek word covers impurity of any kind, in speech or action. Surely it would be unclean to allow one’s hands to stray under another person’s
clothing, to remove another’s clothing, or to caress another’s intimate areas, such as the breasts. In the Bible the caressing of the breasts is associated with the pleasures reserved for married couples.—Proverbs 5:18, 19.
Some youths brazenly defy godly standards. They deliberately go too far, or they greedily seek out numerous partners with whom they can practice sexual uncleanness. Such ones may be guilty of what the apostle Paul
called “loose conduct.” The Greek word for “loose conduct” means ‘outrageous acts, excess, insolence, unbridled
lust.’ Surely you want to avoid coming to be “past all moral
sense” by giving yourself over to “loose conduct to work

Set Clear Boundaries
If you’re dating, how can you avoid inappropriate displays of a?ection? The wise course is to set clear boundaries in advance. Proverbs 13:10 says: “With those consulting together there is wisdom.” So discuss with your partner
what expressions of a?ection are appropriate. Waiting until you’re in some emotion-charged romantic setting before
establishing ground rules is like waiting until your house is
on ?re before installing an alarm.
Granted, such a sensitive discussion can be di?cult
—even embarrassing—especially in the early stages of
courtship. But establishing boundaries can do much to
prevent serious problems from developing later on. Wise

But there’s a side to premarital sex that your peers
may not talk about. For example, Maria, who had sex with

Joseph
Joseph is faced with a serious situation. His master’s
wife has repeatedly implored him to have sex with her.
Now she’s trying again! But Joseph isn’t tempted. In fact,
his reply is resolute. “How could I commit this great badness and actually sin against God?” he says to her.
When she challenges his refusal—even grabbing hold of
him—Joseph isn’t embarrassed to ?ee. In fact, he runs
out of the house! Joseph shows himself to be a man of
moral integrity.—Genesis 39:7-12.
You too may be confronted with a situation in which
someone wants you to give in to your sexual urges. Resisting isn’t merely a matter of willpower. It starts with a
desire to please your Creator, Jehovah God. You see,
Joseph had sexual desires, just as you do. However, it
was unthinkable for him to satisfy those urges in a way
that would o?end his Creator. In the same way, you need
to be convinced that moral uncleanness o?ends God
and that it ultimately leads to heartache. So strive to
develop and maintain the moral integrity that Joseph
displayed.

God give young people sexual desires, knowing that they
should not use them until after marriage?” That’s a good
question. But consider the following:
Are sexual urges the only strong feelings you experience? Not at all. Jehovah God created you with the capacity to feel a wide range of desires and emotions.

you are in control of your desires!

What’s
happening
to my body?
“I got tall really fast. It was painful. Even
though it was exciting to grow, I would get
cramps in my legs and feet. I hated it!”—Paul.
“You know your body is changing, and
you hope no one notices. But then someone
with all good intentions tells you that you
have ‘child-bearing hips’—and you feel
like crawling under a rock and never
coming out again!”—Chanelle.

HAVE you ever moved with your
family to a new neighborhood? The
transition was challenging, wasn’t
it? Really, you were leaving behind everything that was familiar
to you—your house, your school,
and your friends. It likely took
some time for you to
adapt to your new
surroundings.

At the onset of puberty—the stage of life in which you
become physically mature—you enter one of life’s greatest transitions. In a sense, you’re moving to a whole new
“neighborhood.” Exciting? Absolutely! But the move to
adulthood can elicit mixed feelings, and it may not be easy
for you to adapt. What happens during this thrilling yet turbulent time in your life?
Just for Girls
Adolescence is a time of dramatic transition. Some of
the changes you’ll experience will be quite visible. For example, hormones trigger the growth of hair in your genital area.
Also, you’ll notice growth of your breasts, hips, thighs, and
buttocks. Your body is slowly leaving behind the silhouette
of a child and adopting the feminine curves of an adult. This
is nothing to be alarmed about—it’s perfectly normal. And
it’s evidence that your body is preparing itself for the time
when you’ll be able to pass on life through childbirth!
Some time after puberty begins, you’ll experience the beginning of the menstrual cycle. Without adequate preparation, this milestone in your life could be frightening. “I was
totally caught o? guard when I started getting my period,”
recalls Samantha. “I felt dirty. I would scrub myself down in
the shower and think ‘I’m so gross.’ The thought of getting
a period every month
for years to come
terri?ed me!”

Saying good-bye to your
childhood can be like

that your reproductive powers are developing. Even though
it will be years before you’re ready to be a parent, here you
stand poised on the brink of womanhood. Still, the onset of
menstruation can be unsettling. “The worst thing I had to
deal with was the emotional mood swings,” says Kelli. “It
was so frustrating not knowing how I could be so happy all

On the plus side, though, you may notice that you are
becoming bigger and stronger and that your shoulders are
starting to broaden. Also during puberty, hair may grow
on your legs, chest, and face, as well as under your arms.
By the way, the amount of body hair you have has nothing to do with how manly you are; it’s simply a matter of
heredity.
Since not all parts of your body grow at the same rate,
you may experience a degree of clumsiness at this stage.

As your reproductive system matures, your sexual organs will enlarge and hair will grow around them. They will
also begin to manufacture semen. This ?uid contains millions of microscopic sperm, which are released during sexual intercourse. A sperm is capable of fertilizing a female
egg and producing a baby.
Semen builds up in your body. Some is absorbed, but
from time to time, some may be released at night while you
sleep. This is commonly called a wet dream. Such emissions are normal. Even the Bible makes mention of them.

As the reproductive system matures, both boys and

‘Have you been tempted to have sex?’ or ‘Are your peers
pressuring you?’ But maybe you’re just curious.”—Lisa.

If it’s any comfort, your parents may feel as awkward
talking to you about sex as you would feel talking to them!
Perhaps that explains the ?ndings of one survey in which
65 percent of parents reported talking to their children
about sex, but only 41 percent of the children could recall
having such a discussion.
The fact is, your parents may be hesitant to talk about
sex. In many cases their parents simply didn’t talk about it
to them! Whatever the reason, cut your parents a little
slack. Maybe—in a bold move that will bene?t both you
and them—you can bring it up. How?
Broaching the Subject
Your parents have a wealth of wisdom and advice on
the matter of sex. You just need a key to open a discussion. Try the following:
1 State your fear outright, thus getting it out in the open.
“I’m a little hesitant to bring this up because I’m afraid
that you might think . . .”
2 Then tell your parent why you’ve come to him or her.
“But I have a question, and I’d rather have you answer it
than anyone else.”
3 Then just state the issue. “My question is . . .”
4 At the end of the discussion, make sure the door is open
to talk again in the future. “If anything else comes to my
mind, can I talk to you about this again?”
Even if you know the answer will be yes, hearing your
parent say it will keep the door open and make you feel
more comfortable the next time you need to talk. So try it
out! You may end up agreeing with Trina. Now 24, she
says: “At the time my mom and I were talking, I remember
wishing that we weren’t having the discussion at all. But
now I’m glad my mom was so frank and open. It’s been a

There are other feelings that you may have to cope with
during puberty. For example, it’s easy to feel bad about
yourself. Loneliness is common among young people, and
so are bouts of the blues. At such times, it’s good to talk to
a parent or other trustworthy adult. Write the name of an
adult you could talk to about your feelings.

The Most Important Growth
Your most important growth involves, not your height,
shape, or facial features, but your development as a person
—mentally, emotionally and, above all, spiritually. Said the
apostle Paul: “When I was a babe, I used to speak as a babe,
to think as a babe, to reason as a babe; but now that I have
become a man, I have done away with the traits of a babe.”

look like an adult. You must learn to act, speak, and think
like an adult. Don’t become so concerned about what’s happening to your body that you neglect to take care of the inner person!
Remember, too, that God “sees what the heart is.”
(1 Samuel 16:7) The Bible says that King Saul was tall and
handsome, but he was a failure both as a king and as a
man. (1 Samuel 9:2) In contrast, Zacchaeus was “small in
size,” yet he had the inner strength to turn his life around
and become a disciple of Jesus. (Luke 19:2-10) Clearly,
what’s on the inside is what counts most.
One thing is sure: There’s no safe way either to speed
up or to delay the process of physically growing up. So instead of greeting the changes with hostility and fear, accept
them graciously—and with a sense of humor. Puberty isn’t
a disease, nor are you the ?rst one to go through it. And
rest assured, you will survive. When the storm of puberty is
over, you will emerge as a full-grown adult!
What if you don’t like what you
see when you look in the mirror? How can you have a

Some researchers say that most girls who are worried
about their weight have no reason to be. That fact may
provide little comfort, of course, if you truly have a stocky

Genes could play a role. Some people are thin and angular by nature. But if your genes have designated you to have

tremes in dieting. Perhaps the best way to shed pounds is
to adopt a plan of healthful eating and get a reasonable
amount of exercise.
There’s no need to resort to a fad diet. For example, diet
pills may curb your appetite for a while; but the body quickly adjusts to them, and your appetite returns. Or your metabolism slows down, and you gain weight anyway—not
to mention the side e?ects some experience, such as dizziness, high blood pressure, anxiety attacks, and perhaps
even addiction. Much the same can be said for pills that
eliminate water or that speed up your metabolism.
In contrast, a reasonable eating program, balanced with
moderate but regular exercise, will help you look and feel
your best. Moderate aerobics several times a week will work
wonders for your health. Something as simple as a brisk
walk or stair climbing may su?ce.

Beware of the Anorexia Trap!
In their quest to lose weight, some youths have fallen victim to anorexia—a life-threatening eating disorder
that really amounts to self-starvation. Says Masami, after
some four months of getting help for her anorexia: “When
people tell me ‘you look well,’ I say to myself, ‘It must be
because I’m getting fat.’ At times like that, I cry to myself
and I think, ‘If only I could go back to my previous weight
—the weight I was four months ago!”
Anorexia can develop innocently. A young girl might

a few pounds. When she reaches her goal, however, she
isn’t content. “I’m still too fat!” she declares as she stares
disapprovingly at herself in the mirror. So she decides to
lose just a few more pounds. Then just a few more. And a
few more. The pattern is set, and the seeds of anorexia are
sown.
If you have symptoms of anorexia or any other eating
disorder, you need to get help. Con?de in a parent or another trusted adult. A Bible proverb states: “A true companion is loving all the time, and is a brother that is born
for when there is distress.”—Proverbs 17:17.
De?ning True Beauty
On the whole, the Bible places very little emphasis on
one’s physical appearance or bodily shape. Rather, it’s the
inner person that truly makes one either attractive or not

Consider King David’s son Absalom. The Bible says:
“There proved to be no man so beautiful in all Israel as
to be praised so much. From the sole of his foot to the
crown of his head there proved to be no defect in him.”
(2 Samuel 14:25) Yet, this young man was treacherous.
Pride and ambition impelled him to try to usurp the throne
of Jehovah’s appointed king. The Bible, therefore, doesn’t
paint a pretty picture of Absalom but, rather, portrays
him as a man of shameless disloyalty and murderous hatred.
The bottom line is that “Jehovah is making an estimate of hearts”—not the size of a girl’s waistline or a boy’s
biceps. (Proverbs 21:2) So while there’s nothing wrong
with wanting to look good, far more important than your
appearance is your personality. In the long run, spiritual
qualities will make you more attractive to others than chiseled muscles or a ?at stomach!

Bible says: “With evil things God cannot be tried nor does
he himself try anyone.” (James 1:13) Sickness is merely
part of the present human condition, and all of us are subject to “time and unforeseen occurrence.”—Ecclesiastes
9:11.
Happily, Jehovah God has promised a new world in
which “no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’ ” (Isaiah 33:24) Even
those who have died will be resurrected, so that they will
have opportunity to enjoy that new world. (John 5:28, 29)
In the meantime, though, how can you make the best of
your situation?
Try to be positive. The Bible says: “A heart that is joyful does good as a curer.” (Proverbs 17:22) Some might
feel that joy and laughter are inappropriate in the face
of serious illness. But good-natured humor and pleasant
company can refresh your mind and increase your will to
live. So think about what you can do to bring more joy

appropriate physical activity can help you feel better. That’s
why medical facilities often have physical therapy programs for young patients. In many cases proper exercise
not only promotes physical healing but also helps to keep
your spirits up. The point is, honestly assess your situation
and set realistic goals.
Learn to deal with others. What if some make insensitive remarks about your condition? The Bible says: “Do not

that I can cope with this trial, who am I to argue?”
If Someone You Know Is Sick
What if you’re healthy, but you know someone who is
sick or disabled? How can you help that one? The key is
to show “fellow feeling” and to be “tenderly compassionate.” (1 Peter 3:8) Try to understand what that person is
going through. See his challenges through his eyes rather
than your own. Nina, who was born with spina bi?da, says:
“Since my body is small and I’m in a wheelchair, some people talk to me as if I were a child, which can be discouraging to me. Others, though, make an e?ort to sit down and
talk to me, so that we’re at the same eye level. I really enjoy
that!”
If you look beyond their in?rmities, you’ll discover that
those who have health challenges are a lot like you. And
think of it—by your words you have the power to ‘impart a
spiritual gift’ to such ones! When you do so, you too will experience a blessing, for there will be “an interchange of encouragement.”—Romans 1:11, 12.

You can bridge the
chasm that separates
you from your peers

PERHAPS, more than once, you’ve been in the situation
described on the opposite page. You may feel as if a wide
chasm separates you from your peers. You stammer every
time you try to start a conversation with them. When you
do have an opportunity to socialize, shyness rears its head.
Why is simple socializing so di?cult?
Rather than remain stuck on your side of the chasm,
you can build some bridges. Let’s see how.
? Chasm 1: A negative view of yourself. Some youths
relentlessly put themselves down. They’re convinced that
no one likes them and that they have nothing worthwhile
to add to a conversation. Is that the way you feel about
yourself? If so, a negative self-image will only widen the
chasm that separates you from your peers.
The bridge: Focus on your assets. (2 Corinthians

Why did my
friend hurt me?
“Kerry was my very good friend. I picked her up after
work each day, since she didn’t have a car. Soon,
though, I began to feel that she was taking advantage
of me.
“She would get into the car busily talking or textmessaging on her cell phone. She never said thank you
for the rides, and she stopped contributing for gas. And
her conversation was negative. I became furious with
myself for putting up with her for so long!
“One day I kindly explained to Kerry that I wouldn’t
be able to pick her up after work anymore. Since then,
she hasn’t sought out my company—which convinces
me all the more that she only valued my friendship for
what she could get out of me. And it really hurts!”
—Nicole.

IT CAN happen to the best of friends. One day the two are
inseparable; the next day they aren’t even talking to each
other. How does a sweet friendship turn sour so fast?

? For Jeremy, everything seemed to change when a
good friend moved about a thousand miles away. “After
he moved, he never called,” Jeremy says, “and that really
hurt me.”
? Kerrin started noticing a personality change in her
best friend of ?ve years. “Her attitude and speech really
worried me,” Kerrin says. “She became negative and cynical about things that were important to me. When we
tried to talk it out, she accused me of being self-righteous
and disloyal and said that our friendship wasn’t healthy
for her!”
? For Gloria, the end of a close friendship came without
warning or explanation. “At ?rst, we hit it o? great,” Gloria says, “and she told me that I was like a sister to her.
Then, out of nowhere, she stopped doing things with me,
and she’d make up really lame excuses.”
? The trouble between Laura and Daria began when
Daria stole Laura’s boyfriend. “She would talk with him on
the phone for hours, even though he and I were dating,”
Laura says. “I was betrayed by my best friend and lost a
potential marriage mate—both at the same time!”

that sooner or later a friend will do or say something that
hurts you. To be honest, you may recall a few times when
you have hurt others. (Ecclesiastes 7:22) “We’re all imperfect, and we’re going to rub one another the wrong way
once in a while,” says a girl named Lisa. Usually a rift
that’s caused by a minor misunderstanding can be cleared
up with a brief conversation.
In other cases, though, a rift in a friendship isn’t the result of a single event but is caused by a gradual realization
that the two of you aren’t as similar as you once thought.
Remember, as you grow, your interests change—and so
do those of your friend. What can you do when you sense
that you and a friend are drifting apart?

a Friendship

one of your favorite articles of clothing? What did
you do? Throw it away? or

valued the garment. If you really loved that article of clothing, you probably looked for ways to repair it. In many cases, the same is possible with a damaged friendship. Much
depends on what has happened and how much you value
the relationship.1
For instance, if you’ve been the victim of some unkind
word or deed, you may be able to cover over the problem
by following the advice of Psalm 4:4: “Have your say in
your heart, upon your bed, and keep silent.” So before
throwing away the friendship, think carefully. Was the act
intentional? If you can’t be sure, why not give your friend
the bene?t of the doubt? In many cases you can let ‘love
cover a multitude of sins.’—1 Peter 4:8.

whether you set yourself up as a target for ridicule—perhaps by excessive or foolish talking. (Proverbs 15:2) If so,
ask yourself, ‘Do I need to make changes so that my friend
will respect me more?’
“Can We Talk About What Happened?”
What, though, if you feel that you cannot simply dismiss the matter? In that case it might be best to approach
your friend. But be careful not to do so when you’re angry.
The Bible states: “An enraged man stirs up contention,
but one that is slow to anger quiets down quarreling.”
(Proverbs 15:18) So wait until you’ve cooled down before
you attempt to resolve the situation.
When you do approach your friend, remember that

ROLE MODEL

Lydia
Although she is a new believer, Lydia takes the initiative to show hospitality to Paul and his companions.
(Acts 16:14, 15) As a result, she has the privilege of
enjoying the company of these disciples. After Paul and
Silas are released from prison, where do they go? Right
back to the home of Lydia!—Acts 16:40.
Like Lydia, can you take the initiative to get to know
others? How can you do so? Start small. Work on
talking to one person at a time. You could make it a goal
to start a conversation with one person each time you
attend a Christian meeting. Try to smile. If you don’t
know what to say, ask questions or share something
about yourself. Be a good listener. In time, you may be
inclined to say more. People often respond to sincere
words that are kind and pleasant. (Proverbs 16:24)
Because of her friendly and hospitable nature, Lydia was
blessed with good friends. If you imitate her example,
you will be too!

In the end, be assured that although “there exist companions disposed to break one another to pieces,” there’s
also “a friend sticking closer than a brother.” (Proverbs 18:
24) Granted, even the best of friendships may undergo
occasional strain. When that happens, do whatever you
can to mend the relationship. Really, being willing to patch
up di?erences is evidence that you’re becoming a mature
adult.

LOOK at your answer to the ?rst question. Did you indicate that you prefer to communicate by computer rather
than talk face-to-face? If so, you’re far from being alone.
Many youths use the Internet to start and maintain friendships. “The idea of being able to meet people from around
the world—people you’d never be able to meet otherwise—is alluring,” says a young woman named Elaine.
Tammy, 19, points out another enticement. “You can control how people view you,” she says. “When you’re face-toface, if you don’t ?t in, there’s nothing you can do about it.”
Now look at your answers to the second and third
questions. Don’t be surprised if you ?nd it easier to converse with classmates than with fellow Christians at congregation meetings. “At school, there’s a greater chance of
?nding people who are going through the same things you
99

are,” says 18-year-old Jasmine. “That can make them a lot
easier to warm up to.”
Put all the above factors together, and it may seem
only natural that you would want to chat with schoolmates
online. Tammy admits that for a time she did that. “All my
schoolmates talked online about things, and I didn’t want
to be left out,” she says.1 Natalie, 20, set up a Web page to
keep in touch with friends. “Technology is advancing,” she
says. “Communication is ?nding new forms. This is one of
them, and I like it.”
Weighing the Dangers
There’s no question that, for some, making and maintaining friendships is easier online. “The Internet gives
you a form of con?dence that you wouldn’t otherwise
have,” says Natalie. Tammy would agree. “If you’re shy,”
she says, “communicating online gives you a chance to
plan exactly what you will say.”
But there are dangers to communicating online, and it
would be foolish for you to ignore them. To illustrate:

What if you’re just chatting with a trusted friend? Even
then, you need to be careful. “You could spend too much
time conversing with someone of the opposite sex, even if
that person is ‘just a friend,’ ” says Joan. “The more time
you spend sending messages to that person, the closer
your friendship becomes, and conversation has the potential of becoming much more intimate.”
“Those Who Hide What They Are”
King David well knew the value of guarding against the
wrong kind of friends. He wrote: “I have not sat with men
of untruth; and with those who hide what they are I do not
come in.”—Psalm 26:4.

and then take on a personality to ?t the conversation,”
says Abigail, who visited chat rooms.
A girl named Leanne employed another form of deception. She relates: “I regularly communicated online with a boy in a neighboring congregation. We were
soon voicing our feelings of ‘love.’ I would minimize the

never had a clue as to what was going on. I don’t think

don’t let it rob you of time for more important things—including sleep. “Some kids at school said they stayed up till

? When sending photos to your friends, ask yourself,

? Always be aboveboard in your use of the Internet.
If you have to ‘hide what you are’ from your parents,
something’s wrong. “I’m open with my mom,” says a teen
named Kari. “I show her what I’m doing online.”—Hebrews 13:18.
“It’s Worth the Wait!”
You want friends. That’s normal. Humans were created to enjoy the company of others. (Genesis 2:18) So
when you feel the urge to have friends, that’s in harmony
with the way you were made! Just be careful how you
choose them.
Be assured that you can ?nd the best of friends if you
choose them according to the standards of God’s Word.
One 15-year-old girl put it this way: “It’s hard to ?nd
friends who love Jehovah and love you. But when you do

What’s so bad
about gossip?
“Once I went to a party, and the next day rumors
were spread that I had had sex with one of the
boys there. That wasn’t true at all!”—Linda.
“Sometimes I’ll hear a rumor that I’m dating
someone—someone whom, in fact, I don’t even
know! Many people who gossip don’t bother to
check the facts.”—Mike.

GOSSIP can ?ll your life with more intrigue than a feature
?lm. Just ask 19-year-old Amber. “I’ve been a constant
victim,” she says. “It was rumored that I was pregnant,
that I’d had abortions, and that I was selling drugs, buying drugs, and doing drugs. Why would people say these
things about me? Really, I have no idea!”
Armed with e-mail and instant messaging, a boy or a
girl with malicious intent can tarnish your reputation without even speaking a word. All it takes is a few keystrokes
to send a vicious rumor on its way to dozens of eager recipients! In some cases an entire Web site has been set up
just to humiliate someone. More commonly, online blogs
are glutted with gossip that would never be uttered in person.
But is talking about others always bad? Could there be

married or who had a baby. Let’s face it—we can’t say we
care about others if we never talk about them!
Still, casual talk can easily turn into harmful gossip. For
example, the innocent remark “Bob and Sue would make
a good couple” might be repeated as “Bob and Sue are a
couple”—even though Bob and Sue know nothing of their
supposed romance. ‘Not a serious problem,’ you might
say—unless, of course, you were Bob or Sue!
Julie, 18, was the victim of that kind of gossip, and it
hurt. “It made me angry,” she says, “and it raised doubts in
my mind about trusting others.” Jane, 19, was in a similar
situation. “I ended up avoiding the boy I was supposedly
dating,” she says, adding, “It didn’t seem fair, as we were
friends, and I felt that we should be able to talk without rumors starting!”
Steer Your Conversations Carefully
How can you control your tongue when tempted to
gossip? To answer that question, think of the skill that’s
required to drive on a busy highway. Unexpectedly, a situation may arise that makes it necessary for you to change
lanes, yield, or come to a complete stop. If you’re alert, you
see what’s ahead and react accordingly.
It’s similar with conversation. You can usually tell
when a discussion is veering into harmful gossip. When

was boy crazy—and it got
back to her,” relates Mike. “I’ll never forget her voice when she confronted me, how hurt she was over my thoughtless remark. We smoothed things over, but I didn’t feel
good knowing that I had hurt someone in that way!”
There’s no doubt that words can hurt. Even the Bible acknowledges that “there exists the one speaking
thoughtlessly as with the stabs of a sword.” (Proverbs 12:
18) That’s all the more reason to weigh your words before speaking! True, it may take self-control to put the
brakes on a juicy discussion.

“make it your aim to live quietly and to mind your own

How can you show personal interest in others and still
mind your own business? Before talking about someone,
ask yourself: ‘Do I really know the facts? What’s my motive in relating this information? How will my gossiping affect my reputation?’ That last question is important, for
being known as a gossip says more about your character
than that of the person being talked about.
When You Are the Victim
What can you do if you’re the victim of gossip? “Do not
hurry yourself in your spirit to become o?ended,” warns
Ecclesiastes 7:9. Instead, try to put the matter in perspective. The Bible says: “Do not give your heart to all the
words that people may speak, . . . for your own heart well

down evil upon others.”—Ecclesiastes 7:21, 22.

Of course, there’s no excuse for harmful gossip. Yet,
overreacting may cast a more negative light on you than
the actual gossip! Why not, then, adopt the view that
helped Renee? “I’m usually hurt when someone says
something bad about me, but I try to keep it in perspective,” she says. “I mean, next week they’ll probably be talking about someone or something else.”1
Have the good sense, then, to steer conversations
away from harmful gossip. And when unkind talk involves
you, have the maturity not to overreact. Let your good
works speak for you. (1 Peter 2:12) If you do, you will help
to preserve a good relationship with others and to maintain a good standing with God.

Perhaps your parents and teachers have urged you to

an education in a variety of subjects will enrich your understanding of the world around
you. It will help you to
“become all things to

? Tool 2: A positive view of your abilities. School can

Evidently, Timothy had been appointed to some special
service in the Christian congregation. But his God-given
ability—his “gift”—needed to be cultivated so that it
would not lie dormant or go to waste. Of course, your
scholastic abilities are not directly bestowed upon you by
God. Nevertheless, the talents you have are unique to you.
School can help you to discover and nurture abilities that
you never knew you had.

Clearing the Path
Regarding matters pertaining to spiritual progress,
Paul wrote to Timothy: “Give your whole attention, all
your energies, to these things, so that your progress is
plain for all to see.” (1 Timothy 4:15, Phillips) Similarly,
with diligent e?ort, your academic progress will be evident.
Think of the illustration presented at the outset of this
chapter. Trapped in a dense jungle, you would need the
proper tool—a machete—to clear a path. The same is
true with school. Rather than feel overwhelmed by the demands of your parents and teachers, use the three tools
that have been discussed in this chapter to make a success
of school. As your performance improves, you’ll be glad
you did!
As if you didn’t have enough

TERROR is a daily experience for millions of youths who
are bullied at school. “The 15-minute bus ride became a
torture that seemed to last for hours as my tormentors
progressed from verbal abuse to physical mistreatment,”
says a youth named Ryan. Other youths are sexually harassed. “A very popular boy cornered me in the hallway
and started touching me inappropriately,” says young Anita. “Asking him in a nice way to keep his hands to himself
didn’t work. He didn’t think I really meant it.”
Some teens are even hounded online by their classmates. Are you a victim of mistreatment? If so, what can

7:9) The fact is, ‘returning evil for evil’ could add fuel to the
?re and lead to further problems. (Romans 12:17) How,
then, can you beat a bully without using your ?sts?
Take a lighthearted approach. If a taunt is simply an
attempt at humor, try to laugh it o? instead of getting offended. “Sometimes it’s just a matter of not taking aggressive statements so seriously,” says a boy named Eliu. If a
bully sees that his words have little e?ect, he may stop the
harassment.
Use mildness. The Bible says: “An answer, when mild,
turns away rage.” (Proverbs 15:1) A kind reply is what
the bully least expects, and it can defuse a tense situation. True, keeping coolheaded when under attack takes
self-control. But it’s always the better course. Proverbs
29:11 says: “All his spirit is

16:32.
Protect yourself. If a situation seems out of control,
you may need to ?nd an ‘escape route.’ Proverbs 17:14
says: “Before the quarrel has burst forth, take your leave.”
So if violence appears imminent, walk or run away. If escape is impossible, you may need to ward o? violence the
best way you can.
Report it. Your parents have a right to know about
what’s happening. They can also give you practical advice. For example, they might suggest that you speak to a
school o?cial, such as a guidance counselor, about the
matter. Be assured that parents and school o?cials can
handle the matter discreetly, so as not to get you into further trouble.
The bottom line? A bully can’t win if you refuse to play
his game. So don’t get sucked into the ?ames of his anger. Instead, take control of the situation by employing the
foregoing suggestions.
Responding in anger to a
bully’s taunts is like throwing

how to prevent sexual harassment
Don’t flirt. It’s an open invitation to harassment.
The Bible asks: “Can you carry ?re against your chest without burning your clothes?” (Proverbs 6:27, Today’s English
Version) The fact is, ?irting is playing with ?re.
Watch your association. It will be assumed that your
values match those of your friends. A young girl named
Carla says, “If you hang around with ones who give in to
the remarks or who enjoy the attention, then you will get
harassed too.”—1 Corinthians 15:33.
Be careful how you dress. Immodest clothing sends
out a clear signal that you crave the interest of the opposite sex—and you’ll get it.—Galatians 6:7.
Don’t hide your Christian identity. If you do, no one
will have reason to expect you to live up to Christian standards.—Matthew 5:15, 16.

Coping With Sexual Harassment
If you’re being sexually harassed, you have every right
to feel angry! The question is, What can you do about it?
Plenty! Here are a few suggestions.
Firmly refuse sexual advances. Aggressors may assume that a halfhearted no really means yes—or at least
maybe—unless you convince them otherwise. So let your
no mean no. (Matthew 5:37) If you giggle or act coy, even
out of initial embarrassment, it could send the wrong message to the harasser. Be ?rm and direct. That is your best
defense!
Make a scene. Young Anita says of her harasser: “I
had to embarrass him in front of his friends by loudly

“If possible, as far as it depends upon you,

telling him NOT to touch me that way!” The result? “All his
friends laughed at him. He was very cold for a while, but a
few days later, he apologized for his behavior and later
even defended me when someone else tried to bother me.”
If words don’t work, walk away. Better yet, run. And if
escape isn’t possible, you have the right to fend o? molestation. (Deuteronomy 22:25-27) Says one Christian girl,
“When a boy tried to grab me, I punched him just as hard
as I could, and I ran!”
Tell someone. “That’s what I ?nally had to do,” admits 16-year-old Adrienne. “I asked my parents for
advice on the situation when a boy I thought of as a
good friend just wouldn’t leave me alone. The more I protested, the more persistent he became, almost as if it were

Having to deal with
bullying or sexual harassment is no fun. But always remember this: Christian youths need not be helpless victims of bullies; neither
should they tolerate or be allured by the advances of a harasser. By taking the steps mentioned, you can deal with
these challenges.
Peer pressure is one of the most
powerful forces you must deal with. Learn how to face up
to it with con?dence.

“At school you’re faced with so much—smoking,
drugs, sex. You know that what the kids want you
to do is stupid. But you get to this point where you
feel you just can’t chicken out.”—Eve.

IT’S natural to want to be accepted by others. Peer pressure plays on that desire. For example, if you’re being
raised as a Christian, you know that such things as premarital sex and alcohol abuse are wrong. (Galatians 5:1921) Many of your peers, though, urge you to join them in
these activities. Have they thought about these matters and
made their own decision? Not likely. By and large, they

have yielded to the in?uence of others. They want to be accepted, so they allow others to shape what they believe. Do
you? Or do you have the courage to stand up for your convictions?
Moses’ brother, Aaron, gave in to pressure—at least
in one instance. When the Israelites surrounded him and
urged him to make a god for them, he did just what they
told him to do! (Exodus 32:1-4) Imagine—this was the
man who had confronted Pharaoh, boldly declaring God’s
message to him. (Exodus 7:1, 2, 16) But when his fellow Israelites poured on the pressure, Aaron caved in. Evidently,
he found it easier to stand up to the king of Egypt than to
stand up to his peers!

you see a group of your schoolmates up ahead, and they’re
smoking. How likely is it that they’ll o?er you a cigarette?
By anticipating the problem, you’ll be ready either to avoid
it or to confront it.
2. Think. (Hebrews 5:14) You might ask yourself, ‘How
will I feel in the long run if I go along with the crowd?’ True,
you might gain the temporary approval of your peers. But
how will you feel later, when you’re with your parents or fellow Christians? Are you willing to sacri?ce a clean standing
with God just to please your classmates?
3. Decide. (Deuteronomy 30:19) Sooner or later, all
servants of God have to choose either faithfulness and
its blessings or unfaithfulness and its bitter consequences.
Men like Joseph, Job, and Jesus made the right choice,
while Cain, Esau, and Judas chose poorly. Now it’s your
turn to decide. What will you do?
4. Act. You might think this is the hardest part. It’s
not! If you’ve already thought about the consequences and
made up your mind, stating your position can be surprisingly easy—and rewarding. (Proverbs 15:23) Don’t worry

ROLE MODEL

TheThree
Hebrews
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah stand on the plain of
Dura, near Babylon. All around them people bow to the
ground before a giant image. Despite pressure from their
peers and threats from the king, these young men remain
resolute. Respectfully but ?rmly they tell Nebuchadnezzar
that their decision to serve Jehovah is not negotiable.
—Daniel 1:6; 3:17, 18.
These men were youths when exiled to Babylon. Their
faithfulness while young—refusing to eat foods that
may have been forbidden by God’s Law—prepared them
to face di?cult challenges later in life. (Daniel 1:6-20)
They knew from experience that obeying Jehovah was
the wise course. Are you similarly resolved to stick to
God’s standards despite pressure from your peers? If
while you’re young you learn to obey Jehovah in what
might seem to be small matters, you will be better prepared to remain faithful when you face big challenges
later in life.—Proverbs 3:5, 6; Luke 16:10.

If you yield to pressure from your
peers, you become their puppet
(Continued from page 131)

If your peers continue to taunt you,
leave the scene! The longer you stay,
the more intense the pressure will become. Even if you have to walk away,
remember: You took control of the situation. You didn’t let your peers squeeze you
into their mold!
Some of your peers may taunt you and
say that you aren’t thinking for yourself. But
you are! In fact, Jehovah wants you to prove
to yourself that it’s best to do his will. (Romans 12:2) So why let your peers make
you their puppet? (Romans 6:16) Stand up
for what you know to be right!
Realistically, you can’t hide from peer pressure. But you can know your mind, state your position,
and take control. In the end, the choice is yours!—Joshua 24:15.

LOOK at the list on the previous page. Do you engage in
any of those activities behind your parents’ backs? If so,
you probably know that what you’re doing is wrong. You
may even su?er the pangs of a guilty conscience. (Romans 2:15) Still, the thought of revealing your misdeeds to
your parents isn’t a pleasant one. And when you consider
the likely consequences, the argument “What my parents
don’t know won’t hurt them” may seem to make sense. But
has it occurred to you that your course may amount to living a double life? What might have caused you to act that
way?
The Lure of Independence
The Bible says that eventually “a man will leave his father and his mother.” (Genesis 2:24) The same, of course,
can be said of a woman. It’s only natural for you to want
to grow up, to think for yourself, to make your own decisions. But when parents refuse to give permission for
things they consider unwise—or wrong—some youths
rebel.
Granted, some parents may seem to be unusually
strict. “We can hardly see any movies,” complains a young
girl named Kim. She adds, “My father has forbidden us to
listen to just about any music at all!” Faced with what they
see as unreasonable restrictions, some youths begin to
feel envious of their peers, who seem to enjoy much more
freedom.
A young woman named Tammy identi?es another reason why some may live a double life—to ?t in with schoolmates. “I started out by using bad language in school,” she
recalls. “It made me feel I was more like the rest of the
kids. Later I tried smoking. I would also drink alcohol to
the point of feeling high. Then I started having boyfriends

—secretly because my parents were strict and didn’t allow
me to date.”
A teenage boy named Pete had a similar experience: “I
was brought up as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. But I was
very afraid of being teased.” How did Pete cope with his
fear? “I tried to be popular,” he says. “I would lie and make
excuses as to why I didn’t receive any presents during religious holidays.” Once Pete began making small compromises, it wasn’t long before he engaged in more serious
misconduct.
Nothing Is Hidden
Living a double life is nothing new. Some ancient Israelites tried to get away with it too. However, the prophet
Isaiah warned them: “Woe to those who are going very
deep in concealing counsel from Jehovah himself, and
whose deeds have occurred in a dark place, while they say:
‘Who is seeing us, and who is knowing of us?’ ” (Isaiah 29:
15) The Israelites forgot that God saw their deeds. In due
time he called them to account

member, you can’t appease God by simply putting on a
show of devotion when you attend religious meetings. Jehovah knows when people ‘honor him with their lips, but
their hearts are far removed from him.’—Mark 7:6.
Did you realize that those who live a double life grieve
Jehovah? Is that really possible? Indeed it is! When the
people of ancient Israel abandoned God’s Law, “they
pained even the Holy One of Israel.” (Psalm 78:41) How
pained he must be today when youths reared “in the
discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah” secretly do
wrong things!—Ephesians 6:4.
Set Matters Straight
Really, you owe it to God, to your parents, and to yourself to confess to what has been going on in secret. Admittedly, this may result in embarrassment and perhaps
some unpleasant consequences. (Hebrews 12:11) For example, if you’ve carried on a pattern of lying and deception, you’ve undermined your

friendships?
“Sometimes I’d see a group of kids and
think, ‘Wow, they’re really good friends.
I want to be part of that.’ ”—Joe.
“I didn’t have a problem making
friends at school. It was easy. That was
my problem.”—Maria.

EVERYONE needs friends—people they can relax with
during the good times and rely on during the bad. Jesus
had friends, and he enjoyed socializing with them. (John
15:15) Then, when he faced death on a torture stake,
Jesus’ close friend John, “the disciple whom he loved,”
was nearby. (John 19:25-27; 21:20) You need friends like
that—people who will stick with you through thick and
thin!
Perhaps you feel that you’ve found friends like that at
school—one or two of your classmates with whom you’ve
hit it o? well. You share some similar interests and enjoy
talking together. To you they may not seem to ?t the category of ‘bad association.’ (1 Corinthians 15:33) “You see
these kids almost every day,” says Anne. “So you feel comfortable around them. It’s not like being around your spiritual brothers and sisters, where at times you feel you need
to be more careful how you act. At school you can relax.”
In addition, you may ?nd yourself viewing things the way
Lois did, who says, “I wanted my school friends to see
that Jehovah’s Witnesses are not as di?erent as everyone
thinks, to show them we’re normal.” Are those sound reasons to become close friends with your schoolmates?
Why the Need for Caution?
Consider what happened to Maria, quoted at the outset. Her outgoing nature made it easy for her to attract
friends but di?cult for her to know where to draw the line.

I used to act just like the other kids at

That outcome isn’t surprising. After all, to remain close

As your parents have probably drummed into

your attitude toward money can have a profound effect on you. Chapters 18-20 will show you how to

YOU may have similar reasons for wanting to get your
hands on some money. Or perhaps you need to make money to help support your family. Even if you don’t directly contribute to household expenses, paying for your own
clothes or other personal items may relieve your parents of
some economic pressure.
In any event, obtaining things for yourself or for your
family requires money. Although Jesus promised that God

Christian still needs to take the initiative to provide for himself. (Matthew 6:33; Acts 18:1-3; 2 Thessalonians 3:10)
So, how can you make some money? And more important,
how can you keep a balanced attitude toward it?
How to Find a Job
If you really need something that costs more than your
parents can a?ord, you may be able to get a job to earn
enough money to buy it yourself. Talk to your parents
about the idea. They may be impressed by your initiative.
Assuming that they agree and that it’s legal for you to work,
here are four suggestions that will help you to ?nd employment.
Spread the word. Tell your neighbors, teachers, and
relatives that you’re looking for work. If you’re shy about
asking them directly, you might simply ask them what work
they did when they were your age. The more people who
know that you’re looking for work, the more leads and referrals you’ll likely get.
Pursue all leads. Respond to newspaper or Internet want ads and information

Write and distribute a resume. On a piece of paper,
write down how you can be contacted and list your skills
and work experience. You don’t think you have anything to
list? Think again. Have you ever taken care of a younger
sibling when your parents were away, or have you babysat
for others? This shows that you’re responsible. Have you
helped your dad ?x the car? Perhaps this shows that you
have mechanical aptitude. Do you know how to type or use
a computer? Or did you get good marks in school for some

way! Jesus said that real happiness comes to those who are

True, in some parts of the world, youths have no choice

however, you’re not in that situation, why become unbalanced in this regard? According to most experts, working more than 20 hours a week while attending school is

In the hands of a skilled chef, a sharp knife is a useful
tool. But the same knife in the hands of someone inexperienced or inattentive can cause serious harm. Money is
like a sharp knife. If you handle it skillfully, it’s a useful
tool. But if you’re not careful, you can get hurt! For example, the apostle Paul warned against developing a love of
money. In their pursuit of wealth, some sacri?ce friendships, family relationships, and even their relationship

“Money is for a protection; but the advantage
of knowledge is that wisdom itself preserves

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

Or you may face the same dilemma as does Joan, who
says: “Sometimes my friends invite me to do things socially that are expensive. I want to be with my friends, having
fun. Nobody wants to say, ‘Sorry, I can’t a?ord to go.’ ”
Rather than fret about the money you don’t have, why
not learn to manage the money that does pass through
your hands? You could wait until you leave home to learn
how to manage money. But think, Would you jump out of
an aircraft without ?rst learning how to use a parachute?
True, a person might be able to ?gure it all out while hurtling to the earth. How much better, though, if he learned
the basic principles of using the device before jumping out

Similarly, the best time for you to learn to manage
money is while you’re at home, before the harsh ?nancial
realities of life confront you. “Money is for a protection,”
wrote King Solomon. (Ecclesiastes 7:12) But money will
protect you only if you learn how to control your spending.
Doing so will boost your con?dence and will increase your
parents’ respect for you.
Learn the Basics
Have you ever asked your parents to explain what’s involved in maintaining your
household? For instance, do you know

costs to run a car, buy food, or pay
the rent or mortgage? Remember,

What do you spend your money on? If you regularly
spend money helping others, then your money—not just
your words—says that you genuinely care about others.
(James 2:14-17) By regularly donating money to support
true worship, you “honor Jehovah with your valuable
things.” (Proverbs 3:9) On the other hand, if you always
spend your money on your own needs and wants, what
does your money say about you?

you help incur those bills—and if you leave home, you will
be the one who has to pay the bills. So you might as well
know how big your bills are likely to be. Ask your parents
if you can see some of the household bills, and listen closely as they explain how they budget for them.
“A wise person will listen and take in more instruction,
and a man of understanding is the one who acquires skillful direction,” says a Bible proverb. (Proverbs 1:5) Anna
asked for skillful direction from her parents. She says, “My
father taught me how to make a budget, and he showed
me how important it is to be organized in managing family
funds.”
Meanwhile, Anna’s mother taught her other practical
lessons. “She showed me the value of comparing prices
before buying,” Anna says, adding, “Mom could work wonders with a small amount of money.” What has been
the payo? for Anna? “I am now able to care for my own
?nances,” she says. “I carefully control my spending, so I
have the freedom and the peace of mind that come from
avoiding unnecessary debt.”

Recognize the Challenges
Admittedly, controlling your spending is easier in theory than in practice, especially if you live at home and receive an allowance or earn money from a job. Why? Because your parents are likely paying most of the bills. As a
result, a large percentage of your money may be available
for you to spend at will. And spending money can be fun.
A problem may arise, though, if your peers pressure
you into spending beyond reasonable limits. Ellena, 21,
says: “Among my peers, shopping has become a major
form of entertainment. When I’m out with them, there
seems to be an unwritten rule that you must spend money if you’re going to have fun.”
It’s natural for you to want to ?t in with your friends.
But ask yourself, ‘Am I spending money with my friends
because I can a?ord to or because I feel I have to?’ Many
people spend money in an attempt to boost their reputation with friends and associates. They try to impress
others with what they have rather than who they are. This
tendency can cause real ?nancial problems for you, espeDID YOU KNOW . . .

Take Control
Instead of maxing out your
credit card or spending your
whole paycheck on one night
out, why not try Ellena’s solution? “When I go out with
friends,” she says, “I plan
ahead and calculate a limit
to my spending. My pay goes

amount I need for that outing. I also ?nd it wise to go
shopping only with those of my friends who are careful with their money and who will encourage me to shop
around and not buy the ?rst thing I see.”
Here are some other suggestions you may want to apply if you have a credit card.
? Keep track of your purchases and carefully match them
to your monthly statements to be sure that you’re charged
only for purchases you made.
? Pay your credit-card bill promptly. If possible, pay it in
full.
? Be very cautious about giving your credit-card
number and expiration date over the phone or online.
? Avoid using your credit card as a means of obtaining quick cash. Cash advances usually incur a
higher interest rate.
? Never lend your credit card to anyone, not even a friend.
But wouldn’t simply having more

Maybe you think you already have your money under
control. But ask yourself: ‘How much money did I spend
during the past month? What did I spend it on?’ Not sure?
Here’s how to take control of your spending before your
spending takes control of you.
1. Keep a record. For at least one month, record the
amount of money you receive and the date you receive it.

end of the month, add up the amount received and the
amount spent.

3. Adjust your habits. If you’re spending more than
you anticipated on some items and are accumulating debt,
adjust your spending habits. Pay your debts. Stay in control.
Money can be a useful servant if it’s used properly. In
fact, in most cultures, making and managing money is an

should I live abroad?
Some youths want to live abroad to earn
money either for themselves or to support their
family. Others move to learn a foreign language,
to further their education, or to run away from problems at
home. Some Christian youths have moved to lands where
there’s a need for evangelizers. The decision to move to a
foreign land is a big one and should not be taken lightly.
Therefore, if you’re thinking of living abroad, read and
meditate on the scriptures listed below. Ask yourself the
questions, and write your answers on a sheet of paper.
Then prayerfully make your decision.

° What legal requirements are involved?—Romans 13:1.
° What will be the total ?nancial cost of moving abroad?
—Luke 14:28.

° What am I doing now that proves that I would be able to
care for my own physical needs when abroad?
—Proverbs 13:4.

° What advice have I received from mature people who
have lived abroad?—Proverbs 1:5.
° What do my parents think of the idea?—Proverbs 23:22.
° What’s my motive for wanting to move abroad?
—Galatians 6:7, 8.

° If I’m going to live with others, will they encourage me to
maintain good spiritual habits?—Proverbs 13:20.
° What moral, physical, and spiritual dangers might
I face?—Proverbs 5:3, 4; 27:12; 1 Timothy 6:9, 10.
° Realistically, what bene?ts do I expect to gain
from living abroad?—Proverbs 14:15.

O Yes O No

CLEARLY, “poor” is a relative term, meaning di?erent
things in various lands. For example, Gregory may have
thought of himself as poverty-stricken, but compared with
Loyiso he lives in luxury. It’s sobering to realize that no
matter how poor you may be, others are likely worse o?
than you are. Still, when you don’t have decent clothes to
wear to school or when you lack such basics as running water, it may give you little comfort to be told that others have

ROLE MODEL

The Poor Widow
Jesus is watching the rich drop contributions into the
temple treasury chest. In the crowd he notices a needy
widow who donates “two small coins of very little value.”
(Luke 21:2) Jesus praises her act of generosity. Why?
Because the others had donated “out of their surplus, but
she, out of her want, dropped in all of what she had, her
whole living.”—Mark 12:44.
Do you have the same priorities as this woman did?
Are you willing to spend your time and money in serving
God? Like the needy widow, you can donate toward the
maintenance of places of worship. You can also spend
your time and money helping others learn about Jehovah
God. Jehovah noticed and appreciated the small amount
the widow gave in his service. God will also appreciate and help you if your top priority is to do his will.
—Matthew 6:33.

worse. Those who abuse alcohol discover that
“it bites just like a serpent, and it secretes poison just like a viper.” (Proverbs 23:32) Maria, a girl from a poor single-parent family in
South Africa, says, “Trying to escape reality
causes more problems than it solves.”
You may not turn to drinking or
drugs, but you may see little hope
of ever improving your lot in life.
Where can you turn? The Bible’s
wise counsel can be like a key that
frees you from the shackles of despair, enabling you to cultivate a
healthy attitude. Let’s see how.

Examine Your Assets
One positive step you can take is to focus, not on the things you lack, but on the
things you have. Assets such as a home
and a loving family certainly are more valuable than money!
A Bible proverb says: “Better is a dish of vegetables where
there is love than a manger-fed bull and hatred along with
it.” (Proverbs 15:17) Christian youths have an especially
valuable asset—the support of “the whole association of
brothers.”—1 Peter 2:17.
Perhaps you can also try viewing your material possessions in a more positive light. Granted, you may live in a
simple, perhaps even primitive, home. You may wear old,
worn, or patched clothing. And you may long for a more
varied diet. But do you need stylish clothes or an elaborate
home to please God? Do you need fancy meals to stay alive
and in good health? Not really. The apostle Paul learned a
valuable lesson in this regard. He experienced both riches
and poverty. (Philippians 4:12) His conclusion? “If we have

food and clothes, that should be enough for us.”—1 Timothy 6:8, Today’s English Version.
Eldred, a South African man who grew up in a family of little means, says: “We just accepted that the family was living on a tight budget and that we could not get
all we wanted.” Eldred recalls that when his school trousers became threadbare, his mother simply patched them
up—again and again and again! “I had to endure a bit of

they give others hope of a better life in the future, and they
also increase their own feelings of self-respect and dignity.
True, they don’t make money from doing such work. But
recall the message Jesus gave to Christians in the ancient
congregation of Smyrna. They were quite poor materially. Nevertheless, because of their deep spirituality, Jesus
could say to them: “I know your tribulation and poverty
—but you are rich.” Ultimately, because of their actively

Look Ahead
You can develop a close relationship with Jehovah
whether you are rich or poor. The Bible states: “The rich
one and the one of little means have met each other.
The Maker of them all is Jehovah.” (Proverbs 22:2) That
fact has helped thousands of young Witnesses of Jehovah to cope with poverty. They appreciate that happiness
depends, not on owning material things, but on making
friends with Jehovah God, who welcomes all who want to
serve him. God o?ers the hope of life in a future new world
that will be free of grinding poverty.—2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21:3, 4.
In the meantime, use your resources wisely. Look to the
future. Lay up spiritual treasures. (Matthew 6:19-21) View

YOUR PARENTS

6

Parents have the bene?t of hindsight.
They’ve already navigated the maze of
physical and emotional changes that are
part of adolescence. Ideally, they should be
in the best position to guide you through
the maze. Sometimes, though, parents can
seem to be part of the problem—not the
solution. For example, you might face one
of the following challenges:
i O My parents never stop criticizing me.
O My dad or mom is addicted to drugs or alcohol.
O My parents are always arguing.
O My parents have separated.

Chapters 21-25 will help you deal
with these and other problems.

criticism?

I had time to ?nish my chores, she would
inspect my work, looking for mistakes.”—Craig.
“My parents were always lecturing me about
something. They said I just couldn’t seem to get
my act together. School, home, congregation
—they just wouldn’t give me a break.”—James.

DOES it seem as though nothing you do is ever good
enough for your parents? Do you feel that your every move
is being examined under a microscope—that you’re always
being watched and constantly critiqued but you never pass
inspection?
Which of the following do you hear most often?
i O Your room is always a mess. O You stay up too late.
O You watch too much TV.

O You never get up on time.

On the following line, write the parental reminder or
criticism that bothers you the most.

i ..................................................................................................
True, commands and criticism may get on your nerves.
But consider the alternative: If you never received counsel
or discipline, wouldn’t you wonder if your parents cared
about you? (Hebrews 12:8) Really, discipline is evidence of
your parents’ love. The Bible says that a father will reprove
“a son in whom he ?nds pleasure.”—Proverbs 3:12.
You can be grateful, then, that your parents care
enough about you to set you straight! After all, you’re
young and relatively inexperienced. Sooner or later, correction will be in order. Without guidance, you could easily be
overpowered by “the desires incidental to youth.”—2 Timothy 2:22.
But It Hurts!
Of course, “no discipline seems for the present to be
joyous, but grievous.” (Hebrews 12:11) This is particularly
so when you’re young. And no wonder! Your personality is
in its developing stages. You’re still growing up and discovering who you are. So criticism—even when carefully
thought out and delivered in a kind way—may trigger resentment.
How can I deal with criticism? 175

This reaction is understandable, because the value you
place on yourself can easily be in?uenced by what others say about you. And your parents’ opinion in particular
greatly a?ects your sense of self-worth. So when a parent
corrects you or complains about the way you do something,
it can be devastating.
Should you conclude that nothing you do is ever good
enough or that you’re a complete failure simply because
your parents have pointed out a few of your ?aws? No. All
humans fall woefully short of perfection. (Ecclesiastes 7:
20) And making mistakes is part of the learning process.
(Job 6:24) What, though, if your parents seem to have a
lot to say when you do something wrong but little to say
when you do something right? That can hurt. Still, it hardly means you’re a total failure.
Behind the Criticism
Sometimes a parent might seem overly critical, not
because of any particular failing on your part, but
simply because he or she is in a bad mood. Has your
mom had a hard day? Is she struggling with an illness? Then she might be more prone than usual to pick
on you if your room isn’t in tip-top shape. Is your dad

member: “We all stumble many times. If anyone does not
stumble in word, this one is a perfect man.”—James 3:2.
As imperfect humans, parents too can be a?icted with
feelings of inadequacy. In fact, failure on your part can
make them feel as if they have failed. For example, a
mother might criticize her daughter when she brings home
a poor report card from school. But what the mother
might actually be thinking is, ‘I’m afraid that I’m failing as
a mother because I’m not motivating my daughter to succeed.’
Keeping Cool When Under Fire
Whatever is behind the criticism, the question is, How
can you cope with it? First, be careful not to lash out. Proverbs 17:27 says: “Anyone holding back his sayings is possessed of knowledge, and a man of discernment is cool of
spirit.” How can you remain “cool of spirit” when under
?re? Try the following:
Listen. Rather than being quick to justify your actions
or protest your innocence, try to hold back your emotions and absorb what your parents have to say. The disciple James told Christians to be “swift about hearing, slow
about speaking, slow about wrath.” (James 1:19) If you angrily interrupt while your parents are talking to you, they’ll
think that you aren’t listening. This will frustrate them and
inevitably lead to more counsel, not less.

Focus. At times, you may feel that your parents’ counsel was delivered in a less-than-kind manner. Rather than
dwell on the way they spoke to you, though, focus on
what was said. Ask yourself: ‘What part of this criticism
do I know to be true? Have I heard my parents complain
about this matter before? What would it cost me to comply
with their wishes?’ Remember, despite how it may seem at
the moment, your parents’ concern is motivated by love. If
they really did hate you, they wouldn’t discipline you at all.
—Proverbs 13:24.
Rephrase. If you rephrase your parents’ counsel and
repeat it back to them in a respectful manner, you reassure them that you heard what they said. For example, a parent might say: “You always leave your
room in a mess. If you don’t clean it up, you’re grounded!” Now, your room may look

HOUSE RULES, as they’re sometimes called, are the dos
and don’ts that your parents have set for you. Such rules
may include requirements about homework, chores, and
curfews, as well as restrictions on your use of the phone,
the TV, and the computer. Some rules may extend beyond the walls of your home to include your behavior at
school and your choice of friends.
Do you feel hemmed in by these restrictions? Perhaps
you can relate to the following youths:
“My curfew used to drive me crazy! I hated it when others were allowed to stay out later than I was.”—Allen.
“It’s horrible having your cell-phone calls monitored. I
feel that I’m being treated like a child!”—Elizabeth.
“I felt that my parents were trying to wreck my social
life, as though they didn’t want me to have any friends!”
—Nicole.
While young people often ?nd themselves on the
wrong side of their parents’ rules, most youths acknowledge that some regulations are needed to prevent total
chaos. But if house rules are necessary, why are some of
them so annoying?
“I’m Not a Baby Anymore!”
Perhaps you chafe at rules because you feel that
you’re being treated like a child. You want to cry out, “I’m
not a baby anymore!” Of course, your parents probably
feel that their rules are vital if they are to protect you and
prepare you for the responsibilities of adulthood.
Still, it might seem as if the rules in your home have
not “grown up” as much as you have. You might feel restricted, as did a girl named Brielle, who said of her parents: “They have completely forgotten what it’s like to be

my age. They don’t want me to have my say, make a
choice, or be an adult.” A youth named Allison feels similarly. “My parents don’t seem to understand that I’m 18
years old and not 10,” she says. “They need to trust me
more!”
House rules can be especially painful to submit to
if your siblings seem to be given more lenient treatment. For example, recalling his teen years, a young man
named Matthew says of his younger sister and his cousins, “The girls got away with ‘murder’!”

Why so many rules? 183

29:15) The lack of love you see in the world is largely due
to its self-centered people, many of whom were raised in
homes without restraint.—2 Timothy 3:1-5.
Rather than envying youths who are allowed to do as
they please, try to see your parents’ rules as evidence of
their love and concern for you. By enforcing reasonable
limits, they’re imitating Jehovah God, who said to his people: “I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the
way you should go. I will give advice with my eye upon
you.”—Psalm 32:8.
At times, though, you may feel overwhelmed by your
parents’ rules. How can you gain some relief?
Communication That Works
Whether you want to gain more freedom or just reduce your frustration with the limits your parents now
place on you, the key is good communication. ‘But I’ve
tried talking to my parents, and it just doesn’t work!’ some
might say. If that’s how you feel, ask yourself, ‘Could
I improve my communication skills?’ Communication is

what a stupid one lets out, but he that is wise keeps
it calm to the last.” (Proverbs 29:11) So avoid whining,
sulking, and throwing childish tantrums. Admittedly, you
may feel like slamming the door or stomping around the
house when your parents restrict you. However, such behavior will probably lead to more rules—not to more freedom.
Try to see your parents’ point of view. Tracy, a Christian youth in a single-parent family, says, “I ask myself,
‘What is my mother trying to accomplish with her rules?’ ”
Tracy’s conclusion? “She’s trying to help me become a
better person.” (Proverbs 3:1, 2) Showing such empathy
may help you to communicate e?ectively with your parents.
For example, suppose your parents are reluctant to let
you attend a certain gathering. Instead of arguing, you
could ask, “What if a mature, trustworthy friend came
along with me?” Your parents may still not grant your

is it really favoritism?
Have you ever wondered, ‘Why can’t parents treat
everyone exactly the same?’ If so, consider this fact:
Equal treatment isn’t always fair, and fair treatment isn’t
always equal. Really, the question is, Are your needs being
neglected? For instance, when you need your parents’ advice, help, or support, are they there for you? If so, can you
honestly say that you’re the victim of injustice? Since you
and your siblings are individuals with di?erent needs, it
just isn’t possible for your parents to treat all of you the
same way all the time. That’s what Beth came to appreciate. Now 18, she says: “My brother and I are two di?erent
people and need to be treated di?erently. Looking back,
I can’t believe I couldn’t see that when I was younger.”

request. But if you understand their concerns, you have a
better chance of suggesting an acceptable option.
Build your parents’ con?dence in you. Imagine a
man who owes money to a bank. If he makes his payments regularly, he’ll earn the bank’s trust and the bank
may even extend more credit to him in the future. It’s similar at home. You owe your parents your obedience. If you
prove trustworthy—even in small things—your parents
are likely to trust you more in the future. Of course, if you
continually let your parents down, don’t be surprised if
they reduce or even close your “line of credit.”

we hadn’t heard from him all day. Mom tried calling him on the phone. No answer. A little while
later, I noticed that Mom had a worried look on
her face and that she was getting ready to leave.
‘I’m going to check on your dad,’ she told me.
“Later, Mom returned—alone. ‘Dad wasn’t
there, was he?’ I asked. ‘No,’ she replied.
“At that moment I knew that Dad was up to his
old tricks. It was just like the last time. You see,
my dad’s a drug addict. And by the time he came
home, my Mom and I were nervous wrecks.
I basically ignored him all the next day—which
I feel absolutely horrible about.”—Karen, 14.

MILLIONS of youths endure the daily turmoil of living
with a parent who’s hooked on drugs or alcohol. If one of
your parents is enslaved to such an addiction, he or she
may embarrass, frustrate, and even anger you.
Mary, for example, was raised by a dad who seemed
to be a nice person when in public. But he was a closet alcoholic, and at home he subjected his family to profanity
and abuse. “People would come up to us children and tell
us what a wonderful father we had and how fortunate we
were,” Mary recalls bitterly.1
If one of your parents is addicted to alcohol or drugs,
how can you cope?
Behind the Addiction
First of all, it helps to gain some insight into your parent’s problem. “A man of understanding is the one who
acquires skillful direction,” says Proverbs 1:5. So it would
be good for you to learn something about what addiction
is, who gets addicted to alcohol or drugs, and why.
For instance, an alcoholic isn’t simply someone who
overdrinks on occasion. On the contrary, he has a
chronic drinking disorder.2 He’s preoccupied—even obsessed—with alcohol and cannot control his consumption of it once he starts drinking. His addiction causes
painful problems a?ecting his family, work, and health.
While certain people may be physically prone to alcohol addiction, emotional factors also appear to be involved. In fact, many alcoholics often harbor negative
1 If you’re being mistreated by an alcoholic parent, you would do well to seek
help. Con?de in an adult you trust. If you’re one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, you could
approach a congregation elder or another mature Christian.
2 Although we refer to the alcoholic or addict as a male, the principles discussed
also apply to females.

feelings about themselves. (Proverbs 14:13) Some of
them, in fact, grew up in families where their own parents
were alcoholics. For such people, drinking may numb
the pain of childhood emotional scars. The same factors
might be involved when a person is addicted to drugs.
Of course, drinking or taking drugs only compounds a
person’s problems; his thinking and emotions now become even more warped. That’s why your parent may
need considerable help from a trained professional to
break free from his addiction.
Modifying Your Expectations
Granted, understanding why your parent behaves so
badly doesn’t make the problem disappear. Still, having
some insight into his addiction might allow you to view
your parent with a measure of

ROLE MODEL

Hezekiah
Hezekiah is at a crossroads in his life.
At just 25, he’s the king of Judah. What kind of king
will he be? Will he allow the bad example of his father,
King Ahaz, to in?uence him? Right up to his death, Ahaz
had been an unrepentant apostate. He promoted pagan
worship and even burned at least one of Hezekiah’s
brothers on a pagan altar. (2 Chronicles 28:1-4) However, Hezekiah doesn’t permit his father’s hypocritical
conduct to sour him on the worship of Jehovah, nor does
he feel doomed to repeat his father’s mistakes. Instead,
Hezekiah keeps “sticking to Jehovah.”—2 Kings 18:6.
Does one of your parents mock the worship of
Jehovah? Is he or she abusive or a slave to some bad
habit? If so, you don’t have to repeat your parent’s
mistakes! Hezekiah didn’t let his sad family background
ruin his life. In fact, he became such a good king that
“after him there proved to be no one like him among all
the kings of Judah.” (2 Kings 18:5) Like Hezekiah, you
can make a success of your life despite di?cult family
circumstances. How? Keep “sticking to Jehovah.”

ability to play ball with you
would be severely limited.
Grasping that fact would
help you to adjust your expectations.
Similarly, an alcoholic parent or one who
is addicted to drugs is emotionally and mentally crippled. True, the “injury” is selfin?icted. And you may rightly resent your
parent’s foolish conduct. However, until
your parent seeks help to heal his addiction,
he’ll be severely limited in his ability to care for you. Viewing his addiction as an incapacitating injury may help you
to modify your expectations.
What You Can Do
The fact remains that until your parent straightens
out his life, you must live with the consequences of his
behavior. In the meantime, what can you do about it?
Don’t take responsibility for your parent’s addiction. Your parent—and your parent alone—is responsible for his addiction. “Each one will carry his own load,”
says Galatians 6:5. It’s not your job, then, to cure your
parent, nor are you obliged to shield him from the consequences of his addiction. For example, you don’t have to

When he’s sober and calm, perhaps the nonaddicted parent along with the older siblings can tell him how his behavior is a?ecting the family and what he needs to do
about it.
In addition, your addicted parent might do well to
write down the answers to the following questions: What
will happen to me and my family if I keep drinking or taking drugs? What will happen if I give up my habit? What
must I do to get help?
If trouble is brewing, leave the scene. “Before the
quarrel has burst forth, take your leave,” says Proverbs
17:14. Don’t put yourself at risk by getting in the middle
of a quarrel. If possible, retire to your room or go to a
friend’s house. When the threat of violence exists, outside help may be needed.

to honor your parent. (Ephesians 6:2, 3) But “honor”
means to respect his authority, in much the same way as
you are to respect that of a police o?cer or a judge. It
doesn’t mean that you approve of your parent’s addiction. (Romans 12:9) Nor are you a bad person because
you’re repulsed by his drinking or drug abuse; after all,
substance abuse is repulsive!—Proverbs 23:29-35.
Find upbuilding association. When life at home is
chaotic, you can lose sight of what’s normal. It’s important, therefore, that you enjoy the association of people
who are spiritually and emotionally healthy. Members of
the Christian congregation can provide much nurturing

stress. (Proverbs 17:17) Association with Christian families can give you a healthy model of family life to counteract the distorted model you observe at home.

but you can change the way you’re a?ected by it. Rather
than trying to control your parent, focus on the one person you can control—you. “Keep working out your own
salvation,” wrote the apostle Paul. (Philippians 2:12) Doing so will help you maintain a positive outlook, and it
might even prod your parent to seek help for his addiction.

If one of your parents stops living by Bible standards
—perhaps even makes known that he no longer wants to
be part of the Christian congregation—what can you do?
? Realize that Jehovah doesn’t hold you accountable for
your parent’s conduct. The Bible states: “Each of us will
render an account for himself to God.”—Romans 14:12.
? Avoid the tendency to compare yourself with other
youths whose circumstances are better. (Galatians 5:26)
One young man whose father abandoned his family
says, “Rather than dwelling on such thoughts, it is more
helpful to concentrate on ways of coping with the
situation.”
? Continue to show respect for a wayward parent, and if
his orders don’t con?ict with God’s standards, obey them.
Jehovah’s command that children honor their parents
isn’t dependent on whether the parent is a believer.
(Ephesians 6:1-3) When you honor and obey your parents
despite their failings, you prove your love for Jehovah.
—1 John 5:3.
? Associate closely with the Christian congregation.
There you can ?nd the comfort of a large spiritual family.
(Mark 10:30) A young man named David feared that
members of the congregation might avoid him and others
in his family because his father had stopped serving Jehovah. But David found that his fears were unjusti?ed. “We
weren’t made to feel like outcasts,” he says. “This convinced me that the congregation really cared.”

YOU can’t help but be a?ected by your parents’ disputes.
After all, you love them, and you rely on them for support.
As a result, it may devastate you to hear them argue. You
might agree with a girl named Marie, who says, “It’s hard
for me to respect my parents when it seems that they don’t
respect each other.”
Seeing your parents quarrel brings home a painful realization: They aren’t nearly as perfect as you might have
thought. This rude awakening can arouse all kinds of fears.
If the arguments are frequent or intense, you may worry
that their marriage is on the verge of a breakup. “When
I hear my parents ?ghting,” says Marie, “I imagine that
they’ll get a divorce and that I’ll have to choose which one
to live with. I’m also afraid that I’ll be separated from my
siblings.”
Why do parents ?ght, and what should you do when a
family feud erupts?
Why Parents Fight
As a rule, your parents may ‘put up with each other in
love.’ (Ephesians 4:2) But the Bible says: “All have sinned
and fall short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:23) Your
parents aren’t perfect. Therefore, it shouldn’t surprise you
if their irritations build and occasionally become manifest
in the form of an argument.
Remember, too, that we live in “critical times hard to
deal with.” (2 Timothy 3:1) The pressures of making a living, paying the bills, contendDID YOU KNOW . . .

handle certain household chores can become a source of
controversy.
Be assured that if your parents have disagreements,
this doesn’t automatically mean that their marriage is falling apart. In all likelihood your parents still love each other
—even though they di?er in opinion on certain matters.
To illustrate: Have you ever watched a movie with close
friends and found out that your opinion of it di?ered from
theirs? It can happen. Even people who are close to one
another will see certain things di?erently. It could be similar with your parents. Perhaps both are concerned about
the family ?nances, but each has a di?erent view of budgeting; both want to plan a family vacation, but each has a different notion of what constitutes relaxation; or both are
eager for you to succeed at school, but each has a di?erent
idea about the best way to motivate you.
The point is, unity does not require uniformity. Two
people who love each other can see things di?erently at
times. Still, your parents’ con?icts may be di?cult to listen
to. What can you do or say that will help you to endure?
What to Do
Be respectful. It’s easy to become annoyed with bickering parents. After all, they’re supposed to set the example for you—not the other way around. Treating a parent
contemptuously, though, will only add to family tensions.

parents disagree on directly involves you? For example,
suppose one of your parents
is a Christian and the other is an unbeliever. Religious dif?culties may arise in which you must take a stand for righteousness along with the God-fearing parent. (Matthew
10:34-37) Always do so “with a mild temper and deep respect.” Your example in this regard may one day help to
win over your unbelieving parent.—1 Peter 3:15.
Remain neutral. What can you do if your parents pressure you to take sides on issues that don’t directly involve
you? Strive to remain neutral. Perhaps you can excuse
yourself graciously by saying something like this: “Mom
and Dad, I love you both. But please don’t ask me to take
sides. This is something you have to work out between
yourselves.”
Communicate. Let your parents know how their quarreling makes you feel. Choose a time when you think
they’ll be receptive and then respectfully tell them how
their ?ghting upsets, angers, or even frightens you.
—Proverbs 15:23; Colossians 4:6.

What Not to Do
Don’t play marriage counselor. As a youth, you’re
simply not quali?ed to solve your parents’ disputes. To illustrate: Imagine you were a passenger in a small plane
and heard the pilot and the copilot arguing. Understandably, you’d be upset. But what would happen if you presumed to tell the pilots how to ?y the plane or even tried to
take over the controls?
Similarly, trying to ‘take over the controls’ by involving
yourself in your parents’ marital troubles would likely just
make things worse. The Bible says: “By presumptuousness one only causes a struggle, but with those consulting
together there is wisdom.” (Proverbs 13:10) Likely your

together privately.—Proverbs 25:9.
Don’t join in. Two clashing voices are bad enough.
Why add a third voice to the clamor? No matter how
tempting it may be for you to join in, the fact is that it’s
your parents’ responsibility—not yours—to resolve their
disputes. Strive, then, to follow the Bible’s advice to “mind
your own business” in such personal matters. (1 Thessalonians 4:11) Refuse to jump into the fray.
Don’t play one parent against the other. Some
youths actually encourage their parents to argue by pitting
one against the other. When Mom says no, they play on
Dad’s emotions and try to squeeze a yes out of him. Clever manipulation might gain you a little freedom, but in the
long run, it only prolongs family strife.
Don’t let their behavior a?ect your behavior. A youth

Can I be happy in a
single-parent family?
“Kids with two parents can have their own
rooms and buy new clothes. But I have to
share a room; I hardly ever get the kind of
clothes I like. Mom says she can’t a?ord
them. With all the chores I have to do around
the house while she works, I feel like a maid
—like I’m being cheated out of part of my
childhood.”—Shalonda, 13.

NO DOUBTabout it, a home with two loving parents is the
ideal. A dad and mom who are together can usually o?er
more guidance, protection, and support. “Two are better
208 young people ask

o? than one,” says the Bible, “because together they can
work more e?ectively.”—Ecclesiastes 4:9, Today’s English
Version.
Even so, if the two-parent home were an animal, it
would likely be placed on the endangered species list. For
example, more than half the children in the United States
will spend some time in a single-parent family before they
turn 18.
Still, some youths who live in one-parent households
feel ashamed of their circumstances. Others feel overwhelmed by the pressures and problems to which life subjects them. If you live in a one-parent family, what pressures do you encounter? On the line below, write down the
problem that bothers you most.
i ..................................................................................................
Because you’re missing the full-time love and care of
one of your parents, are you doomed to misery? Not at all!
Much has to do with your view of the situation. Proverbs
15:15 says: “All the days of the a?icted one are bad; but
the one that is good at heart has a feast constantly.” As
this proverb implies, a person’s mood is often determined
more by his attitude than by his circumstances. What can
you do to help yourself feel “good at heart” despite your
circumstances?
Counteract Negative Feelings
First, try not to allow the negative comments of others to arouse bad feelings. Some teachers, for example,
have shown glaring insensitivity toward one-parent students. Some have even assumed that any behavioral problem is the result of a faulty home environment. But ask
yourself: ‘Do the people who make these comments really know me and my family? Or are they just parroting
Can I be happy in a single-parent family? 209

what they’ve heard others say about one-parent households?’
It’s worth noting that the expression “fatherless boy”
appears dozens of times in the Scriptures. Not once is this
term used in a derogatory manner. In fact, in nearly every
one of these accounts, Jehovah reveals his special concern
for children who are raised in one-parent homes.1
On the other hand, some well-meaning people might
be overly sensitive when speaking to you. For example,
they may hesitate to use such words as “father,” “marriage,” “divorce,” or “death,” fearing that such words will offend or embarrass you. Does this kind of behavior bother
you? If so, tactfully show them that their concerns are
misplaced. Tony, 14, never knew his real father. He says
some people bite their tongue when it comes to certain
words. However, Tony goes right ahead and uses those
very words when talking to them. “I want them to know I’m
not ashamed of my situation,” he says.
Avoid the “What-Ifs”
Granted, sadness and a sense of loss are only natural if
your parents have divorced or if a beloved parent has died.
Even so, eventually you need

was 10, recommends: “Do not brood over your situation,
having the ‘what-if’ blues, or feel that the problems you
have are because of your one-parent home, or even that
kids in two-parent homes have a cushy life.” This is good
advice. After all, even the “ideal” family is hardly devoid of
problems.
Why not picture your family as a team of oarsmen in a
rowboat? Ideally, the boat would have a full crew. In a
single-parent household, one of the crew is missing and
the rest of the team has to work a bit harder. Does this
mean that the family is a failure? No! As long as the rest of
the team pull together, the boat will stay a?oat and reach
its destination.

With a little e?ort, you can imitate the apostle Paul, who
said: “I have learned to be satis?ed with what I have . . . ,
so that anywhere, at any time, I am content.”—Philippians
4:11, 12, TEV.
Another way to be frugal is to avoid waste. (John 6:12)
Young Rodney says: “Around the house, I try to be careful
not to break or misplace things, since it costs money to repair or replace items. I try to turn o? electrical appliances
or lights not being used. This helps to lower our electric
bills.”
Take the initiative. Many single parents are reluctant
to enforce household rules or to ask their children to help
with chores. Why? Some feel that they need to compensate for the absence of a parent by making life easy for
their children. ‘I don’t want my kids to miss out on having
fun,’ they may reason.

Now, you might be tempted to take advantage of your

Living in a one-parent family gives you the opportunity
to develop such qualities as compassion, unsel?shness,
and dependability. In addition, Jesus said: “There is more
happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” (Acts 20:35)
And great happiness can be yours if you give of yourself by
helping your single parent.
Of course, you’ll wish from time to time that you had a
second parent at home. Still, you can learn to make the
best of your situation. That’s what a girl named Nia found.
“After my dad died,” she says, “someone told me that ‘your
life is what you make it,’ and those words really stuck with
me. They reminded me that I don’t have to be a victim of
my circumstances.” You can adopt a similar outlook. Remember, it’s not your circumstances that make you happy
or unhappy. It’s how you view them—and what you do
about them.

however, the ?ames can quickly spread and destroy the
entire house. That’s bad.
It’s similar with your emotions. When controlled,
they’re bene?cial, enabling you to develop warm friendships. Unrestrained, your emotions can be destructive, not
only to you but also to those around you.
As an adolescent, you may at times ?nd yourself overwhelmed by anger or sadness. How can you control those
emotions? Let’s discuss them one at a time.
Defusing Anger
It isn’t easy to deal with the hurt and pain that arise
when you’re a victim of mistreatment. Some in that position lose their self-control. In fact, the Bible speaks of people who are “given to anger” and “disposed to rage.” (Proverbs 22:24; 29:22) This is no trivial matter. Uncontrolled
anger can cause you to take action that you’ll later regret.
So how can you control your emotions when you’ve been

Coping With Sadness
“Recently I have been moody and overly self-critical,”
says 16-year-old Laura. “I get no joy out of life. I cry
myself to sleep.” Like Laura, many young people feel
overwhelmed by the pressures of life. What about you?
Demands from your parents, friends, and teachers; the
physical and emotional changes of puberty; or the feeling
that you’re a failure because of some minor shortcoming
—these things may leave you feeling miserable.
Some young people even resort to self-injury to relieve
anguish.1 If you’ve fallen victim to such a habit, try to discern the reason. For example, self-injury is often a way of
coping with some form of stress. Is there a situation—perhaps with regard to your family or friends—that is causing
you distress?
One of the best ways to deal with troubled feelings is to
talk to a parent or a mature member of the Christian congregation who could prove to be one who is “born for when
there is distress.” (Proverbs 17:17) Liliana, 16, con?ded in
some adult Christian sisters. “Since they are older than I
am,” she says, “their advice is sound. They have become
my friends.”2 Dana, 15, says

Perfectionism might even impede a person’s worship.
Consider what can happen to a youth who is constantly held
up as an example to others. Always in the limelight, he may
feel as though he’s walking a tightrope, with everyone scrutinizing his performance. Of course, Christians young and

quest to maintain a perfect image may cause a youth to lose
his joy in God’s service. If that happens, the youth needs
help. But he might not ask for it, fearing that he’ll disappoint
those who think so highly of him. He might even be tempted to give up completely, reasoning, ‘If I can’t live up to the

ROLE MODEL

Paul
The apostle Paul is realistic about his feelings. He
candidly admits: “When I wish to do what is right, what
is bad is present with me.” Paul is a good person at heart.
“I really delight in the law of God according to the man
I am within,” he writes. What’s the problem then? Paul
says: “I behold . . . another law warring against the law
of my mind and leading me captive to sin’s law that is in
my members.” Paul’s failings don’t make him happy.
“Miserable man that I am!” he exclaims.—Romans 7:
21-24.
Do your mistakes cause you to feel miserable? If so,
remember that even Paul felt that way at times. But Paul
also knew that Christ died for people like him, leading him
to exclaim: “Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our
Lord!” (Romans 7:25) Paul viewed the ransom as a personal gift. He wrote: “The Son of God . . . loved me and
handed himself over for me.” (Galatians 2:20) When
you feel down, re?ect on the ransom. And if
your failings discourage you, never forget that
Christ died for sinners, not for perfect people.

perfectionism and friendships
Have you shut people out of your life because they
just aren’t good enough for you? Or have good people
stayed away from you because your standards for
friendship appear to be too high? The Bible advises us:
“Do not become righteous overmuch, nor show yourself
excessively wise. Why should you cause desolation to
yourself?” (Ecclesiastes 7:16) One way that the
perfectionist causes desolation to himself is by alienating
those who might otherwise enjoy his company. “No one
likes to be around people who make them feel bad,” says
a girl named Amber, “and I’ve seen perfectionists lose
good friends over some very small things.”

No matter how ?rmly you believe this, it’s just not going to

How can you keep a perfectionist mind-set from taking over your life? Try the following:
Redefine “success.” Are you wearing yourself out
trying to be the very best? The Bible indicates that such an
e?ort can prove to be like “chasing the wind.” (Ecclesiastes
4:4, Today’s English Version) The fact is, few people ever
succeed at being “the best.” And even when a person does,
it’s usually just a matter of time before someone comes
along who performs better. Success means doing your
best—not outdoing someone else’s.—Galatians 6:4.
Be realistic. Your expectations should be equal to
your abilities and limitations. Setting the bar too high
for yourself can be a sign of immodesty—even egotism.

How can I avoid
homosexuality?
“During my teens I struggled with an
attraction to other males. Deep down, I
knew those thoughts weren’t normal.”—Olef.
“My girlfriend and I kissed once or twice.
Since I still liked boys, I wondered if I might
be bisexual.”—Sarah.

FEW would deny that homosexuality is talked about more
openly today than it was several decades ago. And just try
to say that you disapprove of it! Likely, you will be bombarded with criticism. Says 16-year-old Amy, “One girl
told me that I must be prejudiced against people of other
races, because my opinion of homosexuality amounted to
the same thing—prejudice!”
Today’s permissive attitudes have prompted a number of youths to experiment with same-sex relationships.
“Many girls in my school claim to be either lesbian, bisexual, or ‘bi-curious,’ ” says 15-year-old Becky. Christa,
18, ?nds the situation similar at her school. “Two classmates have actually propositioned me,” she says. “One
wrote me a note asking if I wanted to see what it was like
to be with a girl.”
With same-sex relationships being touted so openly,
you may begin to wonder: ‘Is homosexuality really that
bad? What if I’m attracted to someone of my sex? Does
that mean I’m gay?’
How can I avoid homosexuality? 231

How Does God View Homosexuality?
Today, many people—even some clergymen—softpedal the issue of homosexuality. Yet, God’s Word, the Bible, leaves no room for confusion. It tells us that Jehovah God made man and woman and that he purposed
for sexual desires to be ful?lled only between a husband
and a wife. (Genesis 1:27, 28; 2:24) It comes as no surprise, then, that the Bible condemns homosexual acts.
—Romans 1:26, 27.
Some would say that God’s Word is out-of-date. But
why, do you think, are they so quick to make that claim?
Could it be because the Bible’s view con?icts with their
own? Many reject God’s Word simply because it teaches
something di?erent from what they want to believe. That
view is biased, though, and we should rise above such
closed-minded thinking!
But what if you feel attracted to a member of the same
sex? Does this automatically mean that you’re a homosexual? No. Remember, you’re in “the bloom of youth,” a period when you’re subject to involuntary sexual arousal.
(1 Corinthians 7:36) If at times you feel an attraction to
a member of the same sex, be assured that this doesn’t
mean that you’re gay. Such inclinations usually fade with
time. Meanwhile, you must

that “excels all thought.”
This can ‘guard your heart and your
mental powers’ and give you “power beyond what is normal” to keep from acting on wrong desires.—Philippians
4:6, 7; 2 Corinthians 4:7.
Fill your mind with upbuilding thoughts. (Philippians
4:8) Read the Bible daily. Never underestimate its power
to shape your mind and heart for good. (Hebrews 4:12)
A young man named Jason says: “The Bible—including
such scriptures as 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10 and Ephesians
5:3—has had a powerful e?ect on me. I read these scriptures whenever wrong desires occur.”
Shun pornography and gay propaganda. (Colossians 3:5) Avoid anything that will arouse immoral desires. This would include pornography, certain TV shows
and movies, and perhaps even fashion or bodybuilding
magazines that feature lightly clad models. Change negative thoughts to positive ones. “Whenever I have homosexual urges,” says one teenage boy, “I meditate on my favorite Bible text.”

Of course, some claim that there’s no point in doing all
this, that you should simply ‘embrace your sexuality’ and
‘accept who you are.’ But the Bible says that you can do
better than that! It tells us, for example, that some early Christians who had formerly practiced homosexuality
changed. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11) You too can win the battle—even if at this point it’s only being waged in your
heart.
What if same-sex desires persist? Do not give in to
them! Jehovah condemns homosexual acts. Thus, the
person who struggles with same-sex desires is presented
with a reachable goal—he or she can choose not to act on
those desires.
To illustrate: A person might be “disposed to rage.”
(Proverbs 29:22) In the past he may have freely given in to
?ts of anger. After studying the Bible, though, he becomes

that he’ll never again feel anger welling up inside him? No.

“I FIND myself thinking about girls all the time—even
when they’re not around,” says a young man named Michael. “It’s ridiculous. Sometimes I can’t even concentrate!”
Do you, like Michael, spend much of your waking
hours daydreaming about the opposite sex? If so,
you may feel that you’re at war with your own brain.
Thoughts about sex may march into your mind like enemy soldiers. “These thoughts can consume you,” says
Michael. “They can make you take the long route to your
car just to pass a cute girl or get you to walk down a store
aisle when you don’t really need to just to take a closer
look at someone.”
Remember, though, that sexual feelings aren’t evil in
themselves. After all, God created man and woman to
have a strong attraction for each other, and satisfying
sexual desire is proper within the marriage arrangement.
While you’re still single, you may experience intense sexual urges. If that happens, don’t think that you’re inherently bad or that you’re just not cut out for moral cleanness. You can be chaste if you choose to be! But being

Bible’s counsel? “Let us cleanse ourselves of every de?lement of ?esh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God’s
fear.” (2 Corinthians 7:1) Steer clear of any entertainment that might stimulate immoral sexual desires.1
The Problem of Masturbation
Some youths attempt to alleviate sexual arousal by
means of masturbation. But serious problems can result
from this. The Bible urges Christians: “Deaden, therefore, your body members that are upon the earth as respects fornication, uncleanness, sexual appetite, hurtful desire, and
covetousness.” (Colossians
3:5) Masturbation is the
very opposite of ‘deadening sexual appetite.’ Indeed, it stimulates and
nurtures that appetite!

Masturbation can make you a slave to your desires.
(Titus 3:3) One way you can start to conquer the habit is

masturbation for several years comments: “How I wish I
could have summoned the courage to talk to someone
about it when I was a youth! Feelings of guilt plagued me
for many years, and it seriously a?ected my relationships with others and, above all, with Jehovah.”
Whom should you talk to? A parent is often the most
logical choice. Or perhaps a mature member of the
Christian congregation can help. You could start by saying, “I’d like to talk to you about a problem that’s bothering me a lot.”

Should I play
electronic games?

“COMPUTER games are exciting and cool,” says a boy
named Brian. “You get to do things in the game that you
would never actually do in real life—not without getting
into serious trouble, that is.” Deborah says that she too
enjoys playing computer games. However, she adds a
word of caution: “They can be very time-consuming, almost addictive.”
Without a doubt, electronic games are more than just
high-tech entertainment. Sure, they challenge your skill
and help keep boredom at bay. But they do more. Electronic games can sharpen your re?exes. Some of them
may even enhance your math and reading skills. Besides,
the latest electronic game is likely to be the basis for
school-yard conversation. If you’ve played the game, you
have something to talk about with your peers.
Certainly, if you choose carefully, you should be able
to ?nd a game that is both exciting and acceptable. Why,
though, do you need to be cautious?
Their Dark Side
Unfortunately, not all electronic games are harmless fun. A lot of today’s entertainment software

comparison. Many of these violent games can be played
live on the Internet. That ability takes gaming to a whole
new level. “From your home computer,” says 19-year-old
James, “you can challenge people who live on the other
side of the world.”
Internet role-playing games have become hugely popular. In these, participants create online characters
—whether human, animal, or a blend of both—that inhabit a computer-generated world populated by thousands of other players. This online world contains
shops, cars, homes, dance clubs, brothels—in
many ways, it is a replica of the real world. The
players in these games are able to instant message each other as their computer-generated
characters, called avatars, interact.
Ma?a men, pimps, prostitutes, extortionists, counterfeiters, and assassins are
just a few of the sordid characters that
inhabit these online worlds. Players can
indulge in activities they would never carry
out in real life. Just by pressing a few buttons, avatars can engage in sex while the
real-world participants talk about sex via instant messaging. Some games enable players’ avatars to have sex with avatars that
resemble children. Critics are understandably concerned that people would make
a game out of such perverse acts.

sexually graphic games may say:

games, could you be described as being pure and upright? Studies repeatedly show that watching violent entertainment increases aggression in those who view it. In

What Game Should I Choose?
If your parents allow you to play electronic games, how
can you know which to choose and how much time to devote to them? Ask yourself the following questions:
How will my choice a?ect the way Jehovah feels
about me? “Jehovah himself examines the righteous one
as well as the wicked one, and anyone loving violence

you need to follow the advice recorded at Psalm 97:

the most innocent of games can consume a lot of time. So
keep a log of how much time you spend gaming. Is it
crowding out time you need for more important activities?
Keeping track of where your time is going will help you get
your priorities straight.—Ephesians 5:16.
Of course, the Bible doesn’t require that you spend
your whole life studying or doing chores. On the contrary,
it reminds all of us that there is “a time to laugh . . . and a
time to skip about.” (Ecclesiastes 3:4) It’s worth noting,

of your free time to play games that involve physical activity instead of limiting yourself to sitting in front of a video
screen?
Choose Wisely
Without a doubt, playing electronic games can be fun,
especially if you get good at it. And herein lies the very reason for you to choose your games wisely. Ask yourself,
‘What subjects do I do best in at school?’ Aren’t they usually the ones that you enjoy? In fact, it often follows that
the more you enjoy a subject, the greater the impression it
makes on you. Now ask yourself: ‘What game do I enjoy
the most? What moral lessons is this game teaching me?’
Rather than playing a game just because your peers
enjoy it, have the strength to make your own informed
choice. Most important of all, apply the Bible’s advice:
“Keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord.”
—Ephesians 5:10.

..........................................

............................................................................

THE capacity to enjoy melody and harmony appears to be
programmed into all of us. And for many youths, music is
a must-have. “I can’t live without it,” says 21-year-old Amber. “My music is almost always playing—even when I’m
cleaning, cooking, running errands, or studying.”
Rhythm may be based on simple math, but music transcends cold logic and taps straight into our core emotions.
Just as “a word at its right time is O how good!” a song
at the right time can be so consoling! (Proverbs 15:23)
“Sometimes you think that no one else understands your
feelings,” says 16-year-old Jessica. “But when I listen to
my favorite band, I know I’m not the only one who gets depressed.”
Battleground or Common Ground?
While you no doubt love your music, your parents may
have a di?erent viewpoint. “My dad says, ‘Turn o? that
noise! It’s hurting my ears!’ ” comments one teenage boy.
Tired of the hassle, you may feel that your parents are
making a big deal out of nothing. “What about when they
were young?” argues one teenage girl. “Didn’t their parents think their music was bad?” Ingred, 16, complains:

The wrong type in any amount is bad

of music must always become a
battleground. The key is to see
if you can ?nd some common
ground with your parents. If
your parents respect the Bible, you have a real advantage. Why? Because God’s
Word can help both you
and your parents to discern what is de?nitely unacceptable and where there is room for personal taste. To
do this, you need to analyze two key factors: (1) the message of the music you listen to and (2) the amount of music you listen to. First, let’s consider the question . . .
What Is the Message of My Music?
Music is like food. The right type in the right amount is
good for you. The wrong type in any amount is bad. Unfortunately, with music it’s the bad stu? that can be the
most appealing. “Why do all the good tunes get saved for
the really ugly lyrics?” laments a youth named Steve.
If you love the sound, does the message really matter? To help answer that question, ask yourself: ‘If someone wanted to make me swallow poison, how would they
coax me into taking it? Would they dip it in vinegar or coat
it with candy?’ The faithful man Job asked: “Does not the
ear itself test out words as the palate tastes food?” (Job
12:11) So rather than just swallowing a song because

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

you like its beat or melody—the candy coating, so to
speak—‘test out the words’ by considering the title and
the lyrics. Why? Because the lyrics embedded in the music will a?ect your thinking and attitudes.
Regrettably, a great deal of today’s most innovative
music features lyrics that promote sex, violence, and drug
abuse. If you don’t feel that listening to such lyrics a?ects
you, then you’ve already started to succumb to the “poison.”
Think for Yourself
Your peers may put tremendous pressure on you to
listen to degrading music. There’s also pressure from the
music industry itself. With the help of radio, the Internet,
and television, music has become a powerful, multibilliondollar industry. High-powered marketing experts are
hired to shape and control your taste in music.

ROLE MODEL

David
David loves music. He’s a gifted musician and a talented songwriter. He even makes his own instruments.
(2 Chronicles 7:6) David is so skilled that the king of
Israel summons him to perform in the royal court.
(1 Samuel 16:15-23) David accepts. But he doesn’t
become conceited, nor does he allow music to dominate
his life. Rather, he uses his talents to praise Jehovah.
Do you love music? You may not be a talented musician, but you can still imitate David’s example. How?
By not letting music dominate your life or induce you to
think and act in ways that dishonor God. Instead, use
music to enhance your enjoyment of life. The ability to
create and enjoy music is a gift from God. (James 1:17)
David used this gift in ways that pleased Jehovah. Will
you do the same?

257

broaden your taste in music
Do you like more types of food now than you
did when you were ?ve years old? If so, that’s because
you have acquired a taste for new ?avors. It’s similar
with music. Don’t limit yourself to just one style. Try
expanding your taste in music.
One way to do so is to learn to play an instrument.
Not only can this be challenging and satisfying but it
may expose you to other forms of music besides the usual
commercial fodder. Where might you ?nd the time to
learn? You could buy out time from watching TV or playing
electronic games. Note what these youths say.
“Playing an instrument is a lot of fun and can be a great
way to express your feelings. Learning to play new songs
has taught me to like a broad range of musical styles.”
—Brian, 18, plays guitar, drums, and piano.
“You need to practice if you want to learn to play
an instrument well. And practice isn’t always fun. But
mastering a piece of music gives you a good feeling,
a sense of accomplishment.”—Jade, 13, plays the viola.
“When I’m having a hard day or I’m feeling down,
playing my guitar really helps me to relax. It feels so
good to create music that is pleasurable and soothing.”
—Vanessa, 20, plays guitar, piano, and clarinet.
“I used to think, ‘I’ll never be as good as this person
or that person.’ But I stuck with my lessons, and now
I feel real satisfaction when I play a piece of music well.
I also have an increased appreciation for the skill of
other musicians.”—Jacob, 20, plays guitar.

How can you use your perceptive powers when choosing
music? Consider the following suggestions:
Examine the packaging. Often, one look at the
packaging or promotional material is enough to
determine the content. Violent, sexually explicit, or occult images should be a warning. The
music inside is probably objectionable too.
Check out the lyrics. What is being said? Do you really want to listen
to or repeat those ideas over and
over again? Are the thoughts expressed in harmony with your
values and with Christian
principles?—Ephesians 5:
3-5.
Notice the effect. “I
found that a lot of the music
and lyrics I listened to made
me depressed,” says a youth
named Philip. Granted, music
may a?ect people in di?erent ways.
But what mood does your music nurture
in you? Ask yourself: ‘Do I ?nd myself dwelling on wrong
thoughts after hearing the music or the lyrics? Are slang
expressions that are used in the music starting to creep
into my vocabulary?’—1 Corinthians 15:33.
How can I keep music in its place? 259

Consider others. How do your parents feel about
your music? Ask them for their opinion. Think, too, of
how fellow Christians might feel. Would some be disturbed by your music? The ability to modify your behavior
out of respect for the feelings of others is a sign of maturity.—Romans 15:1, 2.
By asking yourself the above questions, you will be in
a position to choose music that stirs your spirit without
killing your spirituality. But there’s one more factor to
consider.
How Much Is Too Much?
Good music, like good food, can be healthful. However, a wise proverb warns: “Is it honey that you have
found? Eat what is su?cient for you, that you may not
take too much of it and have to vomit it up.” (Proverbs 25:
16) Honey has well-known curative properties. Yet, too
much of even a good thing can be bad for you. The point?
Good things should be enjoyed in moderation.
Some youths, however, allow music to dominate their
lives. For example, Jessica, quoted earlier, confesses:
“I listen to music all the time—even when I’m studying
the Bible. I tell my parents that it helps me to concentrate. But they don’t believe me.” Does Jessica’s comment
sound familiar?
How can you determine how much music is too
much? Ask yourself the following questions:
How much time do I spend listening to music each
day? i ..........................................
How much money do I spend on music each month?

Modifying Your Listening Habits
If music is taking too much of a bite out of your personal life, you would do well to set limits and be more moderate in your listening habits. For example, you may need to
break the habit of plugging your ears with headphones all
day long or turning music on the minute you get home.
In fact, why not learn to savor some periods of silence?
Doing so may help you with your studies. “You’ll get a
whole lot more out of them if the music is o?,” says Steve,
quoted earlier. Try studying without music, and see if your
concentration improves.
You will also want to schedule time for reading and
studying the Bible and Bible-based publications. Jesus

Christ at times sought out a quiet place for prayer and
meditation. (Mark 1:35) Is your study environment similarly quiet and peaceful? If not, you may be stunting your
spiritual growth.
Make the Right Choice
Music is truly a gift from God, but you must take care
not to misuse it. Don’t be like the girl named Marlene who
admits: “I have music that I know I’m supposed to throw
out. But it sounds so good.” Think of the harm that she is
doing to her mind and heart by listening to what is bad!
Avoid that snare. Don’t let music corrupt you or take over
your life. Hold to high Christian standards in choosing
your music. Pray for God’s guidance and help. Seek out
companions who share your convictions.
Music can help you relax and unwind. It can help ?ll
the void when you’re lonely. But when the music stops,
your problems are still there. And songs are no substitute
for real friends. So don’t allow music to become the big
thing in your life. Enjoy it, but keep it in its place.
You need to relax once in a while.

YOU’VE worked hard all week. School is over. Your
chores are completed. And you still have some energy to burn, one of the blessings of being young.
(Proverbs 20:29) Now all you want to do is have some
fun.
Your peers may feel that the Bible is anti-fun, that
it restricts you from enjoying yourself. But is that
true? Let’s consider the true-or-false statements listed on the preceding page and see what the Bible really says about having a good time.
? It’s always wrong to take part in sports.

False. The Bible says that “bodily training is bene?cial.”
(1 Timothy 4:8) The original Greek expression for “training” that Paul used here means ‘training as a gymnast’ and
carries the idea of exercise. Today there are numerous
sports—such as skating, cycling, jogging, tennis, baseball,
soccer, and volleyball, to name just a few—that can be
both good exercise and fun.
Does this mean that there’s no need for caution? Well,
consider the context of the verse quoted above. When
writing to the young man Timothy, the apostle Paul said:
“Bodily training is bene?cial for a little; but godly devotion
is bene?cial for all things, as it holds promise of the life
now and that which is to come.” Paul’s words remind us
that our ?rst priority should always be to please God. You
can ensure that godly devotion is your top priority—even
when choosing a sport—by asking yourself the following
three questions:
1. What degree of risk is involved in the sport? Don’t
simply rely on hearsay or on the enthusiastic reports of
other youths. Get the facts. For example, ?nd out the following: Just what is the accident rate for this particular

sport? What safety precautions are taken? What training
and equipment are needed to play this sport safely? While
there are incidental risks in virtually any activity, is the primary objective of this sport to defy injury or death?
Life is a gift from God, and God’s Law given to the Israelites imposed serious penalties if a life was taken accidentally. (Exodus 21:29; Numbers 35:22-25) God’s people
were thereby encouraged to be safety conscious. (Deuteronomy 22:8) Christians today likewise have an obligation to show respect for life.
2. Will the sport provide good association? If you have
some athletic ability, your peers and teachers might exert
pressure on you to join a school team. You may feel a
strong urge to accept the o?er. A Christian youth named
Mark says, “I feel it’s just not fair that my parents won’t let
me join the school team.” But instead of attempting to
coax your parents into accepting your viewpoint, consider
the following facts: Practice sessions and games are usually scheduled outside of normal school hours. If you do well,
you’ll be encouraged to devote more time to the sport. If
you don’t do so well, you’ll feel pressure to spend more

time in practice. In addition, teammates often form close
bonds of friendship as they revel in the highs of victory and
share the despair of defeat.
Now ask yourself: ‘Will spending my personal time in
an activity that could result in close bonds of friendship
with youths who don’t share my spiritual standards be a
good in?uence on me?’ (1 Corinthians 15:33) ‘What price
am I willing to pay just to play on a particular team?’
3. How much time and money will the sport consume?
The Bible instructs us to “make sure of the more important
things.” (Philippians 1:10) To help you apply this advice,
ask yourself: ‘Will playing this sport eat into time that I’ve
allocated for schoolwork or spiritual activities? What is the
total monetary cost of the sport? Does my budget allow for
this expense?’ Answering these questions will help you to
keep your priorities in order.
? All movies and TV shows are a bad in?uence.

what is ?ne” and to “abstain from every form of wicked266 young people ask

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

ness.” (1 Thessalonians 5:21, 22) Not all movies and TV
shows con?ict with that standard.1
Certainly, going to a movie can be a fun way to spend
time with friends. A South African girl named Leigh says,
“If I’m keen on seeing a certain movie, I phone one of my
friends, and we spread the word to our other friends.” Usually this group attends an early showing of the movie. Afterward, their parents pick them up, and together all of
them eat out.
Movies and TV may be modern inventions, but they’re
really just new expressions of an ancient tradition—that
of storytelling. Jesus was a master at reaching peoples’
hearts by means of stories. For example, his parable about
the neighborly Samaritan stirs feelings of empathy and
teaches profound moral lessons.—Luke 10:29-37.
Today moviemakers also teach lessons that mold people’s moral perceptions. They try to make viewers identify with the characters portrayed—even when the hero
is a criminal or a sadistic, power-hungry person. If you
aren’t careful, you may ?nd yourself rooting for a criminal,
mentally justifying his immoral or cruel acts! How can you
avoid this trap?
When choosing a movie or a TV show, ask yourself: ‘Will this program encourage me to be tenderly compassionate?’ (Ephesians 4:32) ‘Or will it coax me

family.
Movie reviews and advertisements can give you some
idea of the content of a movie. But don’t naively put “faith in every word.” (Proverbs
14:15) Why not? A movie review merely re?ects another
person’s opinion. And an advertisement may deliberately
conceal the fact that a movie has o?ensive scenes. A teenager named Connie says, “I’ve found that knowing who the
principal actors are in the movie often gives you some idea
of what the movie is likely to portray.”
Christian peers who share your Bible-based values
may know if a certain ?lm is acceptable.
But remember, people tend to tell you what

Your parents are also a good source of advice. Says young
Vanessa: “I consult my parents. If they think it’s all right
for me to watch, I’ll go see it.”
Don’t take the matter of choosing a movie or a TV program lightly. Why? Because the entertainment you select
opens a window to your heart, revealing what values you
treasure. (Luke 6:45) Your choices tell much about the
kind of association you delight in, the type of language you

the son’s return included “a music concert and dancing.”

Byington) The prophet Isaiah wrote: “Woe to those who
are getting up early in the morning that they may seek just
intoxicating liquor, who are lingering till late in the evening darkness so that wine itself in?ames them! And there
must prove to be harp and stringed instrument, tambourine and ?ute, and wine at their feasts; but the activity of
Jehovah they do not look at.”—Isaiah 5:11, 12.
Those gatherings featured the use of “intoxicating liquor” and wild music. They started early and lasted well
into the evening. Note, too, the attitudes of the revelers
—they behaved as if God did not exist! Little wonder,
then, that God condemned such gatherings.

styles are designed solely to arouse sexual desire. Would
engaging in or just watching such dancing help you to “?ee
from fornication”?—1 Corinthians 6:18.
What if you’re invited to go dancing at a nightclub?
Consider the comments of a youth named Shawn who before becoming a Christian would often hang out at dance
clubs. He recalls: “The music is usually debasing, the
dancing is usually highly immoral, and a great majority of
the people who go there have a motive.” That motive, says
Shawn, is to leave the club with someone to have sex. After studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses, Shawn
had a change of heart. His opinion? “Those clubs are not
the place for Christians.”

his defenses are down and he’s most vulnerable. Similarly, when you’re at school or at work, your spiritual defenses are up. You’re alert to possible danger. It’s later when
you relax with your friends that you’re most vulnerable to
an attack on your moral standards.
Some of your peers may ridicule you for sticking to the
Bible’s high moral standards when it comes to having a
good time. Pressure may even come from youths who
have been raised by Christian parents. But such youths
have had their consciences seared. (1 Timothy 4:2) They
may accuse you of being unbalanced or self-righteous.
Rather than give in to peer pressure, however, “hold a
good conscience.”—1 Peter 3:16.
What really counts isn’t what your peers think of you
but what Jehovah thinks of you! And if your friends hassle
you for following your conscience, it’s time to ?nd some
new friends. (Proverbs 13:20) Remember, you are the
ultimate guardian of your moral standards—even when
you’re having a good time.—Proverbs 4:23.

and easier to access than ever. How can you avoid this

WHEN your parents were your age, people who wanted to view pornography had to search for it. Today, it
seems, pornography searches for you. Says one 19-yearold girl, “Sometimes I’m browsing or shopping on the Internet or even just checking bank statements online when
wham—pornography pops up!” This is hardly unusual.
In one survey, 90 percent of youths between the ages of
8 and 16 said that they had unintentionally encountered
pornography online—in most cases, while doing homework!
In view of its prevalence, you might wonder, ‘Is pornography really all that bad?’ The answer is yes! Pornography demeans both those who take part in it and those
who look at it, and it’s often a stepping-stone to committing sexual sins. But there’s more.
Viewing pornography can become a habit with longlasting, devastating e?ects. For example, consider a man
named Je? who even after 14 years of being free of pornography admitted: “It’s a daily battle. The desire, although much more subdued, is still there. The curiosity is
still there. The images are still there. I wish I’d never started down this hideous path. It seemed so harmless at ?rst.
But now I know better. Pornography is damaging, it is
perverse, and it is demeaning to all parties concerned.

Why live by
Bible standards?
You’re in the cafeteria eating lunch with two girls
at school when the new boy walks in.
“You know, Brett really likes you,” the ?rst girl
says to you. “I can tell by the way he stares at you.
His eyes are all over you!”
“And guess what?” the second girl whispers as
she leans toward you. “He’s available!”
You already suspected all of that. After all, just
the other day Brett invited you to his house for a

party. You declined, of course, although you secretly
wondered what it would have been like.
The ?rst girl interrupts your thoughts.
“Too bad I’m not available,” she says. “I’d go out with
Brett in a heartbeat.”
Then she looks at you, puzzled. You know what’s
coming.
“Hey, how come you don’t have a boyfriend?” she
asks.
You dread that question! The fact is, you’d like to
have a boyfriend. But you’ve been told that it’s best to
wait until you’re ready for marriage before you start
dating. If only it weren’t for . . .
“Your religion, right?” the second girl says.
‘Was she reading my mind?’ you think to yourself.
“With you it’s always Bible, Bible, Bible,” she taunts.
“Why can’t you have a little fun sometimes?”

HAVE you ever been ridiculed because of trying to live
by Bible standards? If so, perhaps you wondered if you
were missing out on something. A youth named Deborah felt that way. “Bible standards felt restrictive,” she recalls. “My school friends’ uninhibited lifestyle appealed to
me.”
A Reality Check
Experience is not always the best teacher. In fact, it’s
both wise and Scriptural to learn from the mistakes of others, as did the psalmist Asaph. For a time, he felt that
God’s standards were too restrictive. But examining the
course of those who had abandoned God’s ways gave him
a reality check. Asaph later concluded that they were on
“slippery ground.”—Psalm 73:18.

and became involved in premarital sex.
? What factors in?uenced your thinking and actions?

Deborah: “I went through school seeing everyone else
having boyfriends and girlfriends, and they seemed to be

and embracing, I felt jealous and lonely. I often allowed
myself to spend hours fantasizing about a certain boy I
liked. This heightened my desire to be with him.”

Andrew: “I habitually viewed pornography on the Internet. I started drinking a lot of alcohol. And I attended
parties with youths who had little respect for the Bible’s
moral standards.”
Tracy: “I knew in my mind that premarital sex was
wrong, but I didn’t hate it. I didn’t intend to start a sexual
relationship before marriage, but my emotions overrode
my thinking. For a while, my conscience was numb to any
feelings of guilt.”

didn’t last. I started to feel dirty, robbed of innocence, empty. I felt a deep sense of regret that I’d thrown away my virginity.”
Andrew: “It became easier and easier to act on wrong
desires. But at the same time, I was consumed with feelings of guilt and was disappointed with myself.”
Tracy: “Immorality ruined my youth. I thought that my
boyfriend and I would have such fun. We didn’t. We ended
up causing each other pain, misery, and heartache. I spent
night after night sobbing in bed, wishing I’d done things Jehovah’s way.”
Mike: “I started to feel like part of me had died. I tried
to disregard the e?ect my actions were having on others,
but I couldn’t. It pained me to realize that in seeking my
own pleasure, I was hurting others.”

people who do the same. You will be happier that way.”

ROLE MODEL

Asaph
Asaph is going through a di?cult time in
his life. All around him he sees people breaking
God’s laws and seemingly getting away with it! As a
result, Asaph wonders if it’s worth putting forth the e?ort
to please God. “Surely it is in vain that I have cleansed my
heart and that I wash my hands in innocence itself,” he
says. After giving the matter deep thought, though,
Asaph changes his mind. He realizes that any enjoyment
the wicked experience is only temporary. Asaph’s conclusion? “Besides you,” he tells Jehovah in song, “I do
have no other delight on the earth.”—Psalm 73:3, 13,
16, 25, 27.
Perhaps at times you have questioned the value of
living by God’s standards. But be like Asaph, and look
beneath the surface. Consider the situation of those
who have disregarded Jehovah’s laws. Are they really at
peace? Have they found some secret to happiness that
those who are faithful to God have missed? After thinking the matter through, you’ll no doubt be moved to echo
the words of Asaph: “The drawing near to God is good
for me.”—Psalm 73:28.

Bible standards

standards recorded in the Bible are for your bene?t. True,
you could view them as a straitjacket that limits your freedom. In reality, though, the Bible’s moral code is more like
a seat belt that helps protect you from harm.
Certainly, you can trust the Bible. If you choose to live
by its standards, you’ll not only make Jehovah happy but
also bene?t yourself.—Isaiah 48:17.

How can
I become
God’s friend?

Through personal tragedy Jeremy came to
appreciate the value of having a friendship with
God. “When I was 12, my father left our family,”
he explains. “One night I was praying in bed, begging Jehovah to make my father come back.”
In his despair, Jeremy began reading his Bible.
When he came upon Psalm 10:14, he was profoundly moved. That verse says of Jehovah: “To
you the unfortunate one, the fatherless boy, commits himself. You yourself have become his
helper.” Jeremy says: “I felt that Jehovah was
talking to me and letting me know that he was
my helper; he was my Father. What better father
could I have than him?”

289

WHETHER you’re in a situation similar to that of Jeremy
or not, the Bible indicates that Jehovah wants you to be
his friend. In fact, the Bible says: “Draw close to God, and
he will draw close to you.” (James 4:8) Think about what
those words mean: Even though you can’t see him—and

Don’t worry, though. Bible study doesn’t have to be a
chore. You can learn to enjoy it
—even if you don’t consider yourself the studying type.
The ?rst thing you need to do is set aside time for Bible
study. “I have a schedule,” says a girl named Lais. “I read
one chapter of the Bible ?rst thing each morning.” Maria,

1. Select a Bible account that you would like to read.
Pray for wisdom to understand the material.
2. Read the account carefully. Take your time.
As you read, use your imagination. Engage as
many of your senses as you can: Try to see the
action, hear the voices of the characters,
smell the air, taste the food, and so forth.
Make the account come to life in your mind!
3. Think about what you just read. Ask
yourself questions, such as the following:
? Why did Jehovah include this
account in his Word?
? Which characters are worthy of
imitation, and which ones serve as
warning examples?
? What practical lessons can I
take away from this reading?
? What does the account teach
me about Jehovah and the way
he does things?

way, don’t give up. Always approach study of the Bible
with the view that you’re taking time to listen to Jehovah
God, your friend. In the end, Bible study will be as exciting
and rewarding as you choose to make it!
Prayer Is Vital
Prayer is the way we talk to God. Think of what an
amazing gift prayer is! You can call on Jehovah God at any
time of the day or night. He’s always available. More than
that, he wants to hear what you have to say. That’s why
the Bible urges you: “In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made
known to God.”—Philippians 4:6.
As that scripture indicates, there are many things you
can talk to Jehovah about. These might include your problems and anxieties. They could also include things that
you’re grateful for. After all, don’t you ?nd yourself thanking your friends for the good things they have done for
you? You can do the same with Jehovah, who has done
more for you than any other friend ever could.—Psalm

comes down to how you

Try this experiment: Take a bucket, and place
several large rocks inside it. Now ?ll the bucket with sand
—all the way to the top. You now have a bucket full of
rocks and sand.
Now empty the bucket, but keep the same sand and
rocks. Try the process in reverse: Fill the bucket with sand,
and then try to place the rocks inside the bucket. No
room? That’s because this time you put the sand in the
bucket ?rst.
The point? The Bible says: “Make sure of the more
important things.” (Philippians 1:10) If you put small
things like recreation in ?rst place, you’ll never seem
to have enough room in your life for the big things
—spiritual pursuits. But if you follow the Bible’s
admonition, you’ll ?nd that you have room for both
Kingdom interests and a measure of recreation. It’s all
a matter of what you put in your bucket ?rst!

There’s another aspect of your friendship with God that

frightening experience. He was on the run from murderous
King Saul—a harrowing ordeal in itself. But then he had to
take refuge among his enemies the Philistines. Faced with
what seemed to be certain death, David cleverly disguised
his sanity and was able to get away.—1 Samuel 21:10-15.
David didn’t attribute his narrow escape to his own ingenuity. Instead, he gave credit to Jehovah. Earlier in the
psalm mentioned above, he wrote: “I inquired of Jehovah,
and he answered me, and out of all my frights he delivered

GOD probably isn’t the most popular topic of conversation among your schoolmates. Bring up almost anything
else—sports, clothes, or the opposite sex—and you’ll
trigger a lively discussion. But mention God, and an awkward silence may quickly descend.
Not that your peers don’t believe in God; many youths
do. But some are embarrassed to discuss the subject. ‘It’s
just not cool,’ they might think.
What About You?
If you’re reluctant to talk to your schoolmates about
God, it’s understandable. No one enjoys being rejected,
and being made fun of is even worse! Could that happen if you talked about your faith? It could. On the other hand, your peers might surprise you. Many of them
are searching for answers to such questions as: Where
is this world heading? and Why is it so full of trouble? Your peers would likely rather talk about those
subjects with someone their
own age than with an adult.
Still, talking to your
peers about religion may
seem like a daunting challenge. Really,
though, you don’t have
to come across as a fanatic,

nor do you have to worry about saying exactly the right
thing. Talking about your faith can be a little like playing a
musical instrument. Challenging at first? Probably. But
with practice it becomes easier, and your efforts will pay
off. How, though, do you get a conversation started?
Usually, you can find a comfortable opening. For instance, perhaps when a current event is being discussed
at school, you can add your Scriptural perspective. Or
you could try speaking to just one classmate. Easier still,
some Christian youths have simply placed a Bible-based
publication on their desk to see if it attracts a classmate’s
attention. Frequently, it does and a conversation follows!

Rest assured, you’re not alone in your feelings about
the evolution theory. The fact is, even a number of scientists don’t accept it. Neither do many teachers and students.
Still, to defend your belief in creation, you need to
know what the Bible really teaches on the subject. There’s
no need to make an issue over things that the Bible
doesn’t directly comment on. Consider a few examples.

My science textbook says that the earth and the solar system have been in existence for billions of years.
The Bible says that the earth and the rest of the universe
were in existence before the first creative day. Thus, the
earth and the solar system may well be billions of years
old.—Genesis 1:1.
My teacher says that the earth could not have been
created in just six days. The Bible doesn’t state that the
six creative days were literal 24-hour periods.
Our class discussed several examples of changes in
animals and humans that took place over time. The
Bible says that God created living things “according to
their kinds.” (Genesis 1:20, 21) It does not support the
idea that life arose from nonliving matter or that God
started off the process of evolution with a single cell.
Still, each “kind” has the potential for great variety. So
the Bible allows for change to take place within each
“kind.”

Be Confident of Your Beliefs!
If you’re being raised by Christian parents, you might
believe in creation simply because that’s what you’ve been
taught. Now that you’re growing older, though, you want
to worship God “with your power of reason,” having a solid foundation for your beliefs. (Romans 12:1) In view of
that, ask yourself, ‘What convinces me that there is a Creator?’ Sam, 14, looks at the human body. “It’s so detailed
and complex,” he says, “and all of its parts work so well
together. The human body couldn’t have evolved!” Hol-

In the end, it’s really evolution, not creation, that requires a huge leap of faith—in e?ect, belief in miracles

? Baptism is a requirement for Christians.

True. Jesus directed that his disciples be baptized.
(Matthew 28:19, 20) In fact, Jesus himself submitted to
baptism. To follow Christ, you need to be baptized when
you’re mature enough to make that decision and have a
genuine desire to do so.
? The main purpose of baptism is to protect you from
giving in to sin.

False. Baptism is a public symbol of your dedication

to do. Rather, you dedicate your life to Jehovah because
you want to live by his standards.

questions often asked about baptism
What does baptism symbolize? Being immersed and
raised up means that you have died to a self-seeking
course and are now made alive to do Jehovah’s will.
What does it mean to dedicate your life to Jehovah?
It means to give up ownership of yourself, promising to put
the doing of God’s will ahead of all else. (Matthew 16:24)
It’s fitting that you make a formal dedication in prayer to
Jehovah sometime before your baptism.
What should you be doing with your life before baptism? You should be living in harmony with God’s Word
and talking to others about your faith. You should be cultivating a friendship with God through prayer and study of
his Word. You should be serving Jehovah because you
choose to do so—not because others are pressuring you.
Is there a certain age by which you should be baptized? Age is not the primary factor. Still, you should be
old enough—and mature enough—to understand the
meaning of dedication.
What if you want to get baptized but
your parents say you should wait?
Perhaps they’d like you to gain more
experience in Christian living.

Plotting Your Course
The full-time ministry is a noble goal, and it brings
countless blessings. Forethought, though, will be needed.
For example, ask yourself, ‘What abilities and skills do I
have that I could use to support myself?’
Kelly had a clear goal of becoming a pioneer, so she plotted her
course when it came to employment. “I had to choose something
that would allow me to support
myself in my ministry,” she says.

“Young People Ask—What Will I Do

This helped her to achieve her primary goal. “The fulltime ministry was what I wanted to do,” Kelly says.
“Everything else was secondary.” Kelly is happy with her
choice. “I feel my decision was the best one that I could
have made,” she says.
Ask for Directions
