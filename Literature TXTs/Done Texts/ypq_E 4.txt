Who Am I?

WHY IT MATTERS
Knowing who you are and what you stand for
will help you to make wise decisions when you
are under pressure.

WHAT WOULD
YOU DO?

Imagine this scenario: Karen is at a party for no more than ten
minutes when she hears a familiar voice behind her.
“Why are you just standing there?”
Karen turns to see her friend Jessica clutching two freshly opened
bottles. She can tell that they contain alcohol. Jessica holds one
bottle right in front of Karen’s face and says, “You’re not too young
to have a little fun, are you?”
Karen wants to refuse, but Jessica is her friend. And Karen doesn’t
want her friend to think she is boring. Besides, Jessica is one of
the good girls. And if she’s drinking, then it must not be so bad.
‘It’s just a drink,’ Karen tells herself. ‘It’s not like taking drugs.’

If you were in Karen’s situation, what would you do?

STOP AND
THINK!

To make a wise decision in this type of situation, you need an
identity. An identity is an inner sense that tells you who you are and
what you stand for. Armed with that knowledge, you’re empowered
to control your life instead of letting others control it for you.—1 Corinthians 9:26, 27.
How can you develop that kind of strength? Answering the following
questions is a good start.

3

WHAT ARE MY
STRENGTHS?

1

BIBLE EXAMPLE: The apostle Paul

wrote: “Even if I am unskilled
in speech, I certainly am not in
knowledge.” (2 Corinthians
11:6) With his thorough grasp
of the Scriptures, Paul was able
to remain ?rm when others
challenged him. He didn’t let
their negative remarks weaken
his con?dence.—2 Corinthians
10:10; 11:5.

Knowing your abilities and positive traits
will boost your con?dence.

ANALYZE YOURSELF.
Below, write down a talent or a skill that you possess.

Now describe a strong quality that you have. (For example, are
you caring? generous? dependable? punctual?)
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

WHAT ARE MY
WEAKNESSES?

Just as a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, your identity
can quickly change for the worse if you let your weaknesses
control your life.

BIBLE EXAMPLE: Paul was aware

ANALYZE YOURSELF.
What weakness do you need to learn to control?

of his weaknesses. He wrote:
“I really delight in the law of
God according to the man I am
within, but I see in my body another law warring against the
law of my mind and leading me
captive to sin’s law.”—Romans
7:22, 23.

Would you get into a taxi and tell the driver to circle the block
repeatedly until his car ran out of fuel? That would be foolish
—and costly!

WHAT ARE
MY GOALS?

The lesson? Goals give your life direction and keep you from going
in circles. You have somewhere to go and a plan of how to get there.

BIBLE EXAMPLE: Paul wrote:

“The way I am running is not
aimlessly.” (1 Corinthians 9:
26) Rather than drift through
life letting things happen to
him, Paul set goals and then
lived in accord with them.
—Philippians 3:12-14.

4

WHAT ARE MY
CONVICTIONS?
BIBLE EXAMPLE: While likely

still a teenager, the prophet
Daniel “resolved in his
heart” that he would obey
God’s laws, even though he
was separated from his family. (Daniel 1:8) By doing so,
he stayed true to himself.
Daniel lived according to his
convictions.

ANALYZE YOURSELF.
Below, write down three goals that you would like to reach within
the next year. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Without convictions, you’ll be indecisive. Like a chameleon, you’ll
change colors to blend in with your peers—a sure sign that you
don’t have your own identity.
In contrast, when your actions are based on your convictions, you
maintain your identity—regardless of what others do.

ANALYZE YOURSELF.
What are your convictions? For example: Do you believe in God?
If so, why? What evidence convinces you of his existence?
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Do you believe that God’s moral standards are for your own good?
If so, why?
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

In the end, which would you rather be like—a fallen leaf that gets
blown around by every mild breeze or a tree that withstands even
powerful storms? Strengthen your identity, and you’ll be like that
tree. And that will help you answer the question, Who am I?

ACTION PLAN

Look at the three goals you identi?ed under question 3. Now write down
one step you can take this month toward meeting each goal.

Why Do I Worry
About My
Appearance?
WHY IT MATTERS
Some things are more important than what
you see in the mirror.

WHAT WOULD
YOU DO?

Imagine this scenario: When Julia looks in the mirror, all she sees
is fat. “I need to lose weight,” she tells herself—even though her
parents and friends tell her she’s “stick-thin.”
Recently, Julia has thought about taking extreme measures to lose
“just ?ve pounds.” All she has to do is starve herself for a few
days . . .

If you felt the way Julia does, what would you do?

STOP AND
THINK!

It’s not wrong for you to be concerned about how you look. In fact, the
Bible comments favorably on the physical appearance of a number of
women and men, including Sarah, Rachel, Abigail, Joseph, and David.
The Bible says that a woman named Abishag was “extremely beautiful.”—1 Kings 1:4.
However, many youths are obsessed with how they look. That can lead
to severe problems. Consider:
? In one study, 58 percent of girls claimed to be overweight, when,
in fact, only 17 percent were.
? In another study, 45 percent of women who were actually underweight thought that they were too heavy!
? In their quest to lose weight, some youths have fallen victim to
anorexia—a life-threatening eating disorder that really amounts
to self-starvation.

6



YOUNG PEOPLE ASK

If you have symptoms of anorexia or any other eating disorder, get help. Start
by con?ding in a parent or another trusted adult. The Bible says: “A true friend
shows love at all times, and is a brother who is born for times of distress.”
—Proverbs 17:17.

THE BEST IMPROVEMENT YOU CAN MAKE!
Really, it’s the inner person that makes one either attractive or not. Consider
King David’s son Absalom. The Bible says:
“No man was as highly praised for his handsome appearance. . . . There was
no flaw in him.”—2 Samuel 14:25.
Yet, this young man was full of pride, ambition, and treachery! The Bible, therefore,
doesn’t paint a pretty picture of Absalom; it portrays him as a man of shameless
disloyalty and murderous hatred.
For good reason, the Bible gives us this advice:
“Clothe yourselves with the new personality.”—Colossians 3:10.
“Do not let your adornment be external . . . , but let it be the secret person
of the heart.”—1 Peter 3:3, 4.
While there’s nothing wrong with wanting to look good, far more important than
your appearance is your personality. In the long run, praiseworthy qualities will
make you more attractive to others than a strong body or a beautiful ?gure will!
“Prettiness can get quick attention,” says a girl named Phylicia, “but who you
are on the inside and your good qualities are what people will remember about
you the most.”

A LOOK AT HOW YOU LOOK
Are you often disappointed with the way you look?

If you answered yes to the ?rst two questions and circled three or more features
in the third, consider this: There’s a good chance that others don’t see you as
negatively as you see yourself. It’s easy to go to extremes and worry about your
appearance too much.—1 Samuel 16:7.

How Can I Talk
to My Parents?
WHY IT MATTERS
The better you get along with your parents,
the smoother your life will be.

WHAT WOULD
YOU DO?

Imagine this scenario: It’s Wednesday night. Geo?, 17, is ?nished
with his chores, and he’s ?nally ready for some well-earned time to
relax! He turns on the TV and collapses into his favorite chair.
At that moment, Dad appears in the doorway, and he isn’t happy.
“Geo?rey! Why are you wasting your time watching TV when you’re
supposed to be helping your little brother with his homework? You
never do as you’re told!”
“Here we go again,” Geo? mutters, loud enough to be heard.
Dad leans forward. “What did you say, young man?”
“Nothing, Dad,” Geo? says with a sigh, rolling his eyes.
Now Dad is really angry. “Don’t use that tone with me!” he says
sternly.

If you were Geo?, how might you have prevented this
confrontation?

STOP AND
THINK!

Communicating with your parents is like driving a car. If you
encounter a roadblock, you can ?nd another route.

9

FOR EXAMPLE:
“I ?nd it di?cult to communicate with my father,” says a girl named Leah. “Sometimes I’ll talk
to him for a while, and then he’ll say, ‘I’m sorry, were you speaking to me?’ ”
LEAH HAS AT
LEAST THREE
OPTIONS.

A

Yell at her dad.
Leah screams,
“Come on, this is
important! Listen!”

B

Stop talking
to her dad.

C

Leah simply gives
up trying to talk to
her dad about her
problem.

Wait for a better
time, and bring up
the subject again.
Leah speaks with her
dad face-to-face later,
or she writes him a letter about her problem.

Which option would you
recommend to Leah?

What other options
might Leah have?

CONSIDER: Leah’s dad is distracted—and thus

See if you can think of one, and write it in the
space provided. Then write down where that
option would likely lead.

unaware of her frustration. So if Leah chooses
Option A, her screaming might seem to come
out of nowhere. This option probably won’t make
Leah’s dad more receptive to her words, and it
won’t show respect and honor for him. (Ephesians 6:2) Really, then, this option will not bene?t
anyone.
While Option B may be the easiest course to
take, it’s not the wisest. Why? Because to deal
successfully with her problems, Leah needs to
talk to her dad—and if he’s going to help her, he
needs to know what’s going on in her life. Silence
accomplishes neither.

Option:
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Consequence:
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

With Option C, however, Leah doesn’t let a roadblock become a dead end. Rather, she tries to
discuss the subject another time. And if she
chooses to write her dad a letter, Leah might feel
better right away.
Writing the letter may also help her to formulate
exactly what she wants to say. When he reads the
letter, Leah’s dad will learn what she was trying to
tell him, which may help him to understand her
plight better. Option C thus bene?ts both Leah
and her dad. Whether face-to-face or with a letter, this option follows the Bible’s admonition to
“pursue the things making for peace.”—Romans
14:19.

YOUNG PEOPLE ASK

Just as you need not let a roadblock
be a dead end, you can ?nd a way to
get through to your parents

“Honor your father and your mother.”
—Ephesians 6:2.

WISE ADVICE
FROM THE BIBLE

“Let your words always be gracious.”
—Colossians 4:6.
“Be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow
to anger.”—James 1:19.

AVOID SENDING MIXED MESSAGES
Remember, what you said and what your parents think you
said do not always match.

FOR EXAMPLE:
Your parents ask you why you seem
to be in a bad mood. You say, “I
don’t want to talk about it.”

Imagine that you are facing a di?cult problem and
your parent o?ers to help. But you say: “Don’t worry.
I can handle it myself.”

But your parents hear: “I don’t trust
you enough to con?de in you. I’ll talk
to my friends about the problem but
not to you.”

Your parents may hear:

How Can I Fix
My Mistakes?
WHY IT MATTERS
Admitting your mistakes will
make you a more responsible and
trustworthy person.

WHAT WOULD
YOU DO?

Imagine this scenario: While playing with his friends, Tim throws
a ball that crashes through a neighbor’s window.

If you were Tim, what would you do?

STOP AND
THINK!

12 

YOU HAVE THREE OPTIONS:

A

Run.

B

Blame someone else.

C

Tell the neighbor what happened, and o?er to pay for
the damages.

You could be tempted to
select Option A. But there
are always good reasons
for you to admit your
mistakes—whether they
involve a broken window
or anything else.

TO ADMIT YOUR
MISTAKES

important, it pleases God.
3 Most
The Bible says: “Jehovah detests a devious person, but
His close friendship is with the upright.”—Proverbs 3:32.
Karina, 20, tried to keep a speeding ticket a secret from her
dad. But she couldn’t keep it hidden forever. “About a year
later,” Karina says, “my dad noticed a speeding ticket under
my name. I got into so much trouble!”
Lesson learned? Karina says: “Keeping mistakes a secret
only makes things worse. You still pay for them later on!”

HOW TO LEARN
FROM YOUR
MISTAKES

The Bible says: “We all make mistakes many times.”
(James 3:2, footnote) And as we have seen, it is a sign
of humility and maturity to admit your mistakes—and to
do so right away.
The next step is to learn from your mistakes. A girl named
Vera says: “I try to view each mistake as a learning experience and let it be a lesson that will help me to be a better
person and handle the situation di?erently the next time.”
Let’s see how you can do that.

You borrow your father’s
bike and damage it. What
would you do next?

* Say nothing and hope your dad doesn’t notice.

You fail a test because you
did not study for it. What
would you do next?

* Blame the test.

* Tell your dad exactly what happened.
* Tell your dad what happened but blame someone
else.

* Accept responsibility for your failing grade.
* Claim that the teacher has something
against you.

13

Now look back at the preceding scenarios, and try to imagine that you are (1) your dad and (2) your teacher. What
would your dad and your teacher think of you if you readily
admitted your mistakes? What would they think of you if
you covered up your mistakes?
Now think about a mistake that you made during the past
year and answer the following questions.

What was the
mistake? How
did you handle
that mistake?

* I covered it up.

If you didn’t
admit your
mistake, how
did you feel
afterward?

* Great—I got away with it!

* I blamed someone else for it.
* I readily admitted it.

* Guilty—I should have told the truth.

Dwelling on past mistakes is like
staring in the rearview mirror
while driving a car

How could you have handled the situation better?
What did you learn from your mistake?

WHAT DO YOU THINK?
Why do some people hold back from admitting their mistakes?
What will people think of you if you always try to cover up your mistakes,
but what will they think of you if you admit your mistakes?—Luke 16:10.

ACTION PLAN
During the next 12 months, what goal could you set with regard to handling your mistakes?

What if I’m
Being Bullied
at School?
WHY IT MATTERS
How you respond can make things better
—or worse.

WHAT WOULD
YOU DO?

Imagine this scenario: Thomas doesn’t want to go to school today.
Or tomorrow. Or ever again. It all started three months ago when
his schoolmates spread vicious rumors about him. Then came the
nicknames. Sometimes someone will knock Thomas’ textbooks
out of his hands and act as if it were an accident, or one person in
a group behind him will shove him, and by the time Thomas turns
around, he can’t tell who did it. Yesterday, the bullying took an even
more sinister turn when Thomas received an online threat . . .

If you were Thomas, how would you respond?

STOP AND
THINK!

You are not totally powerless! In fact, you can ?ght a bully without
using your ?sts. How?

15

? DON’T REACT. The Bible says: “A stupid person gives vent to all his feelings, but
the wise one calmly keeps them in check.” (Proverbs 29:11) If you remain as calm as
possible—at least on the outside—those bullying you may well lose interest.
? DON’T RETALIATE. The Bible says: “Return evil for evil to no one.” (Romans 12:17)
Seeking revenge will only make the situation worse.
? DON’T WALK INTO TROUBLE. The Bible says: “The shrewd one sees the danger
and conceals himself.” (Proverbs 22:3) To the extent possible, avoid people who
could cause trouble, and avoid situations where bullying may occur.
? TRY AN UNEXPECTED RESPONSE. The Bible says: “A mild answer turns away rage.”
(Proverbs 15:1) You can even try humor. For example, if a bully asserts that you’re
overweight, you could shrug your shoulders and say, “I guess I could lose a few
pounds!”
? WALK AWAY. “Silence shows that you are mature and that you are stronger than
the person harassing you,” says 19-year-old Nora. “It demonstrates self-control
—something the bully doesn’t have.”—2 Timothy 2:24.
? WORK ON YOUR SELF-CONFIDENCE. Bullies can often detect those who think negatively of themselves and who are thus not likely to ?ght back. In contrast, many
bullies will back o? if they see that you aren’t giving them any power over you.
? TELL SOMEONE. A former schoolteacher says: “I would urge anyone who is being
bullied to speak up. It’s the right thing to do, and it can prevent someone else from
being bullied.”

DID YOU KNOW?
Besides physical assaults, bullying can also include:
Verbal attacks. “I’ll never forget the names they called me or the things
they said. They made me feel worthless, unwanted, and good-fornothing. I’d rather have been given a black eye.”—Celine, 20.
Social isolation. “My schoolmates started to avoid me. They would
make it seem that there was no room at the lunch table, so I couldn’t sit
with them. For the whole year, I cried and ate alone.”—Haley, 18.
Cyberbullying. “With just a few keystrokes on a computer, you can ruin
someone’s reputation—or even his life. It sounds like an overstatement,
but it can happen!”—Daniel, 14.

BULLYING QUIZ
TRUE OR FALSE

ANSWERS

1 Bullying has been around
for thousands of years.

1 True. For example, the Bible tells of the Nephilim—a group whose
name means “Those Who Cause Others to Fall Down.”—Genesis 6:4.

2 Bullying is just harmless
teasing. It’s not that serious.

2 False. Bullying is a contributing factor in a large number of
youth suicides.

3 The best way to stop a
bully is to ?ght back.

3 False. Bullies are often physically stronger than their victims,
so attempts at retaliation are futile.

4 If you witness bullying,
it’s best to ignore it.

4 False. In this case, there’s no such thing as an innocent bystander.
If you see bullying and don’t say anything, you may become part of the
problem rather than part of the solution.

5 Beneath the boastful talk,
bullies are often insecure.

5 True. Although some bullies have a big ego, many are insecure and put
others down to make themselves feel better.

6 Bullies can change.

6 True. With help, bullies can change the way they think and act.

How Can I Resist
Peer Pressure?
WHY IT MATTERS
When you stand up for yourself, you will
be in control of your life, instead of letting
others control it for you.

WHAT WOULD
YOU DO?

Imagine this scenario: As two of his schoolmates approach, Brian
feels a knot in his stomach. Twice already this week, they’ve tried
to get him to smoke. This will be their third attempt.
The ?rst boy speaks:
“All alone again? Let me introduce you to a friend.”
He underscores the word “friend” with a wink as he takes something out of his pocket and extends his hand toward Brian.
Brian sees the cigarette between the boy’s thumb and fore?nger.
The knot in Brian’s stomach gets even tighter.
“Sorry,” Brian says. “I’ve already told you that I don’t . . .”
The second boy interrupts: “Don’t be such a coward!”
“I’m not!” Brian summons the courage to say.
The second boy places his arm around Brian’s shoulder. “Just take
it,” he says softly.
The ?rst boy moves the cigarette closer to Brian’s face and adds in
a whisper: “We won’t tell anyone. No one will ever know.”

If you were Brian, how would you respond?
18 

YOUNG PEOPLE ASK

STOP AND
THINK!

Have Brian’s peers really thought about what they are doing? Have
they made their own decisions? Not likely. In general, they have
yielded to the in?uence of others. They want to be accepted, so
they allow others to shape what they do.
If you were confronted with the same situation, how could you
choose a di?erent path and resist peer pressure?

1

ANTICIPATE
The Bible says: “The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself,
but the inexperienced keep right on going and su?er the consequences.”
—Proverbs 22:3.
Often, you can see trouble in advance. For example, suppose you see a group
of your schoolmates up ahead, and they’re smoking. By anticipating a problem, you’ll be ready to deal with it.

2

THINK
The Bible says: “Maintain a good conscience.”—1 Peter 3:16.
Ask yourself, ‘How will I feel in the long run if I go along with the crowd?’ True,
you might temporarily avoid the disapproval of your peers. But how will you
feel later? Are you willing to sacri?ce your identity just to please your classmates?—Exodus 23:2.

3

DECIDE
The Bible says: “The wise one is cautious.”—Proverbs 14:16.
Sooner or later, we have to make a choice and live with the consequences. The
Bible tells of men like Joseph, Job, and Jesus, who all made the right choice. It
also tells of Cain, Esau, and Judas, who made bad choices. What will you do?
The Bible says: “Act with faithfulness.” (Psalm 37:3) If you’ve already thought
about the consequences and made up your mind, stating your position can be
surprisingly easy—and rewarding.
Don’t worry—you don’t have to give your peers a lecture.
A simple but ?rm NO may su?ce. Or to make your nonnegotiable stand clear,
you could say:
“Count me out!”
“I don’t do that sort of thing!”
“Come on, you know me better than that!”
The key is to respond promptly and with conviction. If you do, you might be
surprised at how quickly your peers will back o?!

19

DEALING WITH
RIDICULE

What if your peers mock you? What if they say, “What’s wrong—are
you a coward?” Recognize this sort of taunt for what it is—crude
peer pressure. How can you respond? You have at least two options.
You could absorb the taunt. (“You’re right, I am scared!” Then
brie?y state your reason.)
You could return the pressure. State your reason for refusing,
and then appeal to your peers’ intellect. (“I thought you were
too smart to smoke!”)
If your peers continue to taunt you, walk away! Remember, the longer you stay, the more intense the pressure will become. By leaving
the scene, you show that you refuse to let others change who you
are.
Realistically, you can’t hide from peer pressure. But you can decide
what you want to do, state your position, and take control. In the
end, the choice is yours!—Joshua 24:15.

How Can I Deal
With the Pressure
to Have Sex?
WHY IT MATTERS
Your decisions about sex will have
far-reaching e?ects on your future.

WHAT WOULD
YOU DO?

Imagine this scenario: Heather has been seeing Mike for only two
months, but she feels as if she’s known him forever. They text each
other constantly, they talk for hours at a time on the phone, and
they can even ?nish each other’s sentences! But now Mike wants
more than conversation.
During the past two months, Mike and Heather have done nothing
more than hold hands and brie?y kiss. Heather doesn’t want to go
further. But she doesn’t want to lose Mike either. No one makes her
feel so beautiful, so special. ‘Besides,’ she tells herself, ‘Mike and I
are in love . . .’

If you are old enough to date and you were in Heather’s
situation, what would you do next?

STOP AND
THINK!

If you defy a physical law, such as the law of gravity, you will su?er the
consequences. The same is true if you defy a moral law, such as the
one that states: “Abstain from sexual immorality.”—1 Thessalonians
4:3.
What are the consequences of disobeying that command? The Bible
says: “Whoever practices sexual immorality is sinning against his own
body.” (1 Corinthians 6:18) How is that true?

21

Researchers have found that many youths who
have had premarital sex usually experience one
or more of the following consequences.
DISTRESS. Most youths who have engaged in
premarital sex say that they regretted it afterward.
DISTRUST. After having sex, each partner
begins to wonder, ‘Who else has he/she had sex
with?’
DISILLUSIONMENT. Deep down, many girls
would prefer someone who will protect them, not
take advantage of them. And many boys ?nd
that they are less attracted to a girl who has given in to their advances.
The bottom line: If you give in to premarital
sex, you degrade yourself by forfeiting something precious. (Romans 1:24) Your body is far
too valuable to give away!
Show that you have the strength of character
to “abstain from sexual immorality.” (1 Thessalonians 4:3) Then, if you do marry one day, you
can have sex. And you’ll be able to enjoy it fully,
without the worries, regrets, and insecurities that
are so often part of the aftermath of premarital
sex.—Proverbs 7:22, 23; 1 Corinthians 7:3.

FOR GIRLS
ONLY

Sex is a gift from God
for married persons only.
Premarital sex is an abuse
of that gift. It’s like taking a
beautiful garment someone
gave you and using it as a
cleaning cloth

A number of boys have said that they would never marry a girl
they have had sex with. Why? Because they prefer someone
who is chaste!
Does that surprise you—perhaps even anger you? Then remember
this: Movies and TV shows glamorize teen sex and make it look like
harmless fun or even true love.
But don’t be naive! Those who would try to coax you into
premarital sex are only looking out for their own interests.
—1 Corinthians 13:4, 5.

YOUNG PEOPLE ASK

FOR BOYS
ONLY

If you are dating, ask yourself, ‘Do I really care for my girlfriend?’
If your answer is yes, how can you best show it? By having the
strength to uphold God’s laws, the wisdom to avoid tempting circumstances, and the love to look out for her interests.
If you have such qualities, then likely your girlfriend’s feelings will
be similar to those of the morally upright Shulammite who said:
“My dear one is mine and I am his.” (Song of Solomon 2:16)
In short, she will love you even more!

WHAT DO YOU THINK?
* Would anyone who truly loves you endanger your physical and
emotional well-being?
* Would anyone who truly cares for you tempt you to jeopardize
your relationship with God?—Hebrews 13:4.

How will you respond if someone asks you to have sex?

If someone tries to

doing it.

What Should
I Know About
Sexual Assault?
WHY IT MATTERS
Each year millions of people are raped
or otherwise sexually abused, and young
people are a prime target.

WHAT WOULD
YOU DO?

Annette’s attacker threw her to the ground before she realized
what was happening. “I tried everything I could to ?ght him o?,”
she says. “I tried to scream, but only air escaped my lungs.
I pushed, kicked, punched, and scratched. And that’s when I felt
a knife pierce my skin. I went completely limp.”

If you were in a situation like that, how would you react?

STOP AND
THINK!

While you might be prepared—perhaps by being alert when you travel
outdoors at night—bad things can happen. “The swift do not always
win the race,” says the Bible, “nor do those with knowledge always
have success, because time and unexpected events overtake them
all.”—Ecclesiastes 9:11.
Some youths, like Annette, are assaulted by a stranger. Others are
attacked by an acquaintance or even a family member. At just ten
years of age, Natalie was sexually abused by a teenager who lived
near her home. “I was so scared and ashamed that at ?rst I didn’t tell
anyone,” she says.

24 

YOUNG PEOPLE ASK

YOU ARE NOT
TO BLAME

Annette still deals with feelings of guilt over what happened. “I keep
playing that night over and over again in my head,” she says. “I feel as
though I should have tried harder to ?ght him o?. The fact is, after being stabbed, I was paralyzed with fear. I couldn’t do anything more,
but I feel that I should have.”
Natalie also struggles with feelings of guilt. “I shouldn’t have been so
trusting,” she says. “My parents had a rule that my sister and I had to
stay together when we played outside, but I didn’t listen. So I feel I
gave my neighbor the opportunity to hurt me. What happened a?ected my family, and I feel responsible for causing them so much pain. I
struggle with that the most.”
If your feelings are similar to those of Annette or Natalie, keep foremost in mind that a person who is raped is not a willing participant.
Some people make the issue seem less serious, using the excuse that
it is normal for boys to act that way or that victims of rape were asking
for it. But no one deserves to be raped. If you were the victim of such
a heinous act, you are not to blame!
Of course, reading the statement “you are not to blame” is easy; believing it may be much more di?cult. Some hold in their feelings about
what happened and su?er from guilt and other negative emotions. But
who is best served by silence—you or the abuser? You owe it to yourself to consider another option.

TELLING YOUR
STORY

Your feelings might be
too heavy for you to carry
by yourself. Why not get
help by talking to someone
about them?

The Bible tells us that at the height of his personal turmoil, the righteous man Job said: “I will speak out in my bitter distress!” (Job 10:1)
You may bene?t from doing the same. Talking to a trusted con?dant
can help you to come to terms with what happened and help you to
gain relief from overwhelming emotions.
Annette found that to be true. She says: “I talked to a close friend,
and she urged me to speak with a couple of Christian elders in my congregation. I’m glad I did. They sat down with me on several occasions
and told me exactly what I needed to hear—that what happened was
not my fault. None of it was my fault.”
Natalie talked to her parents about the abuse. “They supported me,”
she says. “They encouraged me to talk about it, and that helped me
not to be so sad and angry inside.”
Natalie also found comfort in prayer. “Talking to God helped me,” she
says, “especially at those times when I felt that I couldn’t open up to
another human. When I pray, I can speak freely. It gives me a real
sense of peace and calm.”
You too can ?nd that there is “a time to heal.” (Ecclesiastes 3:3) Take
care of yourself physically and emotionally. Get needed rest. And most
of all, rely on the God of all comfort, Jehovah.—2 Corinthians 1:3, 4.

25

IF YOU ARE
OLD ENOUGH
TO DATE

If you are a girl and you are being pressured to engage in unclean
conduct, there’s nothing wrong with ?rmly stating, “Don’t do that!” or,
“Take your hand o? me!” Don’t hold back out of fear that you’ll lose
your boyfriend. If he breaks up with you over this issue, he’s not worth
keeping! You deserve a real man, one who respects your body and
your principles.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT QUIZ
“In middle school, boys would pull on the back of my bra and make derogatory comments—like how much
better I would feel once I had sex with them.”—Coretta.

Do you think that those boys were
A

Teasing her?

B

Flirting with her?

C

Sexually harassing her?

“On the bus, a boy started saying nasty things to me and grabbing me. I smacked his hand away and told
him to move. He looked at me like I was crazy.”—Candice.

What do you think this boy was doing to Candice?
A

Teasing her?

B

Flirting with her?

C

Sexually harassing her?

“Last year, a boy kept telling me that he liked me and that he wanted to go out with me, even though I
constantly told him no. Sometimes, he rubbed my arm. I told him to stop, but he wouldn’t. Then, while I
was tying my shoe, he smacked my rear end.”—Bethany.

In your opinion, was this boy:
A

Teasing her?

B

Flirting with her?

C

Sexually harassing her?

The correct choice for all three is C.

What makes sexual
harassment di?erent from
?irting or teasing?

Sexual harassment is one-sided. It continues even when
the victim tells the person to stop.
Harassment is serious. It can lead to sexual violence.

Should I Believe
in Evolution?
WHY IT MATTERS
If evolution is true, life has no lasting
purpose. If creation is true, we can ?nd
satisfying answers to questions about
life and the future.

WHAT WOULD
YOU DO?

Imagine this scenario: Alex is confused. He has always believed
in God and in creation. But today his biology teacher forcefully
claimed that evolution is a fact, that it is based on credible scientific research. Alex doesn’t want to appear foolish. ‘After all,’ he says
to himself, ‘if scientists have proved evolution to be true, who am I
to question them?’

If you were Alex, would you accept evolution just because
the textbooks present it as fact?

STOP AND
THINK!

People on both sides of the debate are often quick to state what they
believe without really knowing why they believe it.
* Some people believe in creation simply because that’s what they’ve
been taught at church.
* Some people believe in evolution simply because that’s what
they’ve been taught at school.

Claiming that life did not
have a Creator is as absurd
as claiming that this house
did not have a builder

SIX QUESTIONS
TO CONSIDER

The Bible says: “Every house is constructed by someone, but the one
who constructed all things is God.” (Hebrews 3:4) Is that reasonable
to believe?
CLAIM: Everything in the universe came as a result of a
random big bang.

V1
V2

Who or what caused the big bang?
Which makes more sense—that everything came from
nothing or that everything came from someone?

CLAIM: Humans evolved from animals.

V3
4
V

If humans evolved from animals—from apes, for example—
why is there such a huge gap between the intellectual
abilities of humans and those of apes?
Why are even the most “basic” forms of life so incredibly
complex?

CLAIM: Evolution is a proven fact.
5
V
6
V

Has the person making this claim investigated the evidence
for himself?
How many people believe in evolution simply because they
have been told that all intelligent people believe in it?

“If you were walking through the forest and discovered
a beautiful house, would you think: ‘How fascinating!
The trees must have fallen in just the right way to make
this house.’ Of course not! It’s just not reasonable. So
why should we believe that everything in the universe
just happened to come about?”—Julia.

YOUNG PEOPLE ASK

“Imagine that someone told you
that there was an explosion at
a printing plant and that the ink
spattered onto the walls and
ceilings and formed the text of
an unabridged dictionary. Would
you believe it?”—Gwen.

WHY BELIEVE
IN GOD?

The Bible encourages you to use your “power of reason.” (Romans
12:1) That means your belief in God should not be based merely on

EMOTION (I just feel that there must be a higher power)
THE INFLUENCE OF OTHERS (I live in a religious community)
PRESSURE (My parents raised me to believe in God
—I had no choice)
Instead, you should have sound reasons for your belief.

“When I’m in class listening
to the teacher explain how
our bodies function, there’s
no doubt in my mind that
God exists. Each part of the
body has its own function,
down to the smallest detail,
and these functions are
often carried out without
our awareness. The human body truly is mindboggling!”—Teresa.

TO THINK
ABOUT

“When I see a skyscraper, a
cruise ship, or a car, I ask
myself, ‘Who built this?’
It takes intelligent people
to build a car, for example,
because so many small
components have to work
just right for the whole
thing to function. And if
cars have to be designed
by someone, then so do
we humans.”—Richard.

“The more I studied science,
the less credible evolution
seemed. . . . To me, it takes
more ‘faith’ to believe in
evolution than to believe
in a Creator.”—Anthony.

Despite decades of research, scientists have yet to come up with
an explanation for evolution that they can all agree on. If scientists
can’t agree on evolution—and they are supposed to be the experts—
are you wrong to question the theory?

ACTION PLAN
Imagine that a schoolmate says to you: “I don’t believe in God. Do
you?” Write down what you would say.

How Can the
Bible Help Me?
WHY IT MATTERS
The Bible says that “all Scripture is inspired
of God.” (2 Timothy 3:16) If this is true, then
the Bible can give you the direction you need.

Imagine this scenario: David is driving in an area where nothing
looks familiar. The street signs and landmarks show that he is not
where he should be by now. David realizes that he is lost. He must
have taken a wrong turn at some point in his journey.

WHAT WOULD
YOU DO?

If you were David, what would you do?

STOP AND
THINK!

You have several options:
A

Ask for directions.

B

Consult a map, or use a GPS.

C

Keep driving, hoping that somehow you will ?nd your way.
Obviously, Option C is the least e?ective.
Option B has an advantage over the ?rst. After all, a map or a GPS
will be at hand throughout the journey, helping you to guide your
course.

ANSWERING
LIFE’S BIG
QUESTIONS

From the moment we can talk, we ask questions.
Why is the sky blue?
What are the stars made of?
Later we begin to ask questions about the world around us.
Why do bad things happen?
Why do people die?
What if the answers to those questions have been
in the Bible all along?
Many people say that the Bible is full of myths and legends, that it’s
outdated, or that it’s just too hard to understand. But is the Bible
really the problem, or is what people have heard about the Bible the
real problem? Could they be misinformed?
For example, people think that the Bible says that God controls the
world. But how could that be? This world is out of control! It is full of
pain and su?ering, sickness and death, poverty and disaster. How
could a loving God be responsible for all of this?
Would you like to know the answer? What the Bible says about who
controls the world may surprise you!
