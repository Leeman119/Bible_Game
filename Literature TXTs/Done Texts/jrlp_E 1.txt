CHAPTER ONE

“I H AVE P UT M Y WORDS
IN YOUR M OUTH ”
“THERE exists a friend sticking closer than a brother.” (Prov. 18:24) Have you experienced the truth of
those inspired words? You can trust what a real friend
says. When he tells you something good or explains
what he will do, you believe it. If he points out something needing adjustment, you likely accept it and act
accordingly. He has proved over time that he has your
interests at heart, even when o?ering you counsel. He
wants you to succeed, and you want the same for him
so that your friendship will last.
2

In many respects, you ?nd such friends in the men

whom God used to write the books of the Bible. What
you hear from them, you can believe. You are sure
that what they say is for your good. The ancient Israelites should have felt that way about the “men
[who] spoke from God as they were borne along by
holy spirit.” (2 Pet. 1:20, 21) The one whom God used

to write the largest prophetic book was Jeremiah,
who also wrote Lamentations and two other Bible
books.
3

You may have noted, though, that some Bible

readers tend to view Jeremiah’s writings as ‘not for
them.’ They may imagine that the books of Jeremiah
and Lamentations o?er only dire warnings and grim
predictions.1 But is that a realistic view of Jeremiah
and Lamentations?
4

Granted, what Jeremiah wrote presents frank as-

sessments, yet you know that at times a friend also
does that. Even Jesus spoke out when his friends, the
apostles, displayed wrong attitudes; he plainly corrected them. (Mark 9:33-37) Nonetheless, Jesus’ main
message was positive, showing the way to gain God’s
approval and future happiness. (Matt. 5:3-10, 43-45)
It is similar with Jeremiah’s writings, which are part
of “all Scripture” that is bene?cial for “setting things
1 A number of languages use the word “jeremiad,” meaning “denunciatory complaint” or “angry tirade.” The Washington Post newspaper described a ?lm on ecological and climate change as an “inconvenient jeremiad.”

straight.” (2 Tim. 3:16) Jeremiah did clearly state
God’s view of those who claimed to serve Jehovah
but who deserved to reap the consequences of their
bad ways. Still, the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations contain a message of hope and show how our
future can be blessed. Jeremiah included prophecies
about how God’s dealings would develop, and today
we are directly involved in the ful?llment. Furthermore, you will ?nd in those two books statements
that are positive and encouraging.—Read Jeremiah 31:
13, 33; 33:10, 11; Lamentations 3:22, 23.
5

Both our present happiness among God’s people

and our prospects for the future are linked to things
that Jeremiah wrote. Our uni?ed brotherhood is an
example. His writings will help us to strengthen that
brotherhood and to apply the apostle Paul’s counsel:
“Brothers, continue to rejoice, to be readjusted, to be
comforted, to think in agreement, to live peaceably;
and the God of love and of peace will be with you.”
(2 Cor. 13:11) Jeremiah’s writings also relate directly
to the message we preach. While we tell others about

the last days and warn of the approaching end of this
system, our message is still positive, o?ering a basis
for hope. Moreover, what Jeremiah wrote is very useful in practical ways. Our situation ?nds many parallels in his life and in his message. To appreciate that,
consider the background and assignment of this exemplary prophet to whom God said: “Here I have put
my words in your mouth.”—Jer. 1:9.
6

A husband and wife awaiting the birth of a child

think often about their future son (or daughter).
What will he be like, and what will he do in life—his
interests, career, and accomplishments? Your parents
likely thought about those things. It must have been
similar with Jeremiah’s parents. However, his case
was special. Why? The Creator of the universe was
particularly interested in Jeremiah’s life and activities.—Read Jeremiah 1:5.
7

Yes, before Jeremiah was born, God used His fore-

knowledge. He took special interest in a boy who
would be born into a priestly family living north of

what situation was he born?

Jerusalem. That was in the middle of the seventh century B.C.E., not a happy time in Judah because of the
bad rulership of King Manasseh. (See page 21.) During much of his 55-year reign, Manasseh did what was
bad in Jehovah’s eyes. Thereafter, his son Amon followed a similar course. (2 Ki. 21:1-9, 19-26) A dramatic change came about with the next Judean king. Yes,
King Josiah searched for Jehovah. By the 18th year
of his reign, Josiah had cleansed the land of idolatry.
That must have pleased Jeremiah’s parents; it was
during Josiah’s reign that God commissioned their
son.—2 Chron. 34:3-8.
Why do you have reason to be interested in the books of
Jeremiah and Lamentations?

8

We do not know Jeremiah’s age when God told

him: “Prophet to the nations I made you.” He might
have been close to 25 years old, the age at which a
priest could enter the ?rst phase of his service. (Num.
8:24) In any event, Jeremiah responded: “Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Here I actually do not know

how to speak, for I am but a boy.” (Jer. 1:6) He felt
reluctant, perhaps thinking he was too young or unquali?ed for the serious responsibility and the public
speaking required of a prophet.
9

Jeremiah was commissioned during the time when

King Josiah was eliminating detestable false worship and promoting true worship. However much interaction there was between Jeremiah and Josiah,
the climate was clearly favorable for a true prophet.
Zephaniah and Nahum also served in Judah early in
Josiah’s rule.1 Huldah the prophetess did too, but she
foretold bad times ahead. And Jeremiah lived to experience them. (2 Ki. 22:14) In fact, at times, such
friends as Ebed-melech and Baruch had to rescue Jeremiah from certain death or protect him from vengeful enemies.
10

How would you feel if God said that you were

specially commissioned as a prophet to deliver a
1 Later in Jeremiah’s prophetic career, other prophets were his contemporaries: Habakkuk, Obadiah, Daniel, and Ezekiel. Jeremiah had
served some 40 years when calamity came to Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E.,
and he lived for over 20 years after that.

strong message? (Read Jeremiah 1:10.) Consider just
one example of what Jeremiah had to declare. In
609 B.C.E., Babylonian forces were moving toward Jerusalem. King Zedekiah sought a favorable message
from God through Jeremiah. But that is not what
God had for that king.—Read Jeremiah 21:4-7, 10.
A HUMAN LIKE US
11

Imagine that we had to deliver scathing denunci-

ations and judgments against wicked kings, corrupt
priests, and false prophets. Jeremiah had to do so. But
we have God’s backing, and so did Jeremiah. (Jer. 1:
7-9) God showed con?dence in young Jeremiah, emboldening him with the words: “I have made you today a forti?ed city and an iron pillar and copper walls
against all the land, toward the kings of Judah, toward her princes, toward her priests and toward the
people of the land. And they will be certain to ?ght
against you, but they will not prevail against you, for
‘I am with you,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘to deliver you.’ ”—Jer. 1:18, 19.
11. Why might Jeremiah have found it di?cult yet reassuring to carry out
his assignment?
“I Have Put My Words in Your Mouth”

12

No one need think of Jeremiah as some incredi-

bly formidable person. He was a human like us. Moreover, it is signi?cant that though Jeremiah lived in
another era, he faced situations similar to those we
face. We interact with various types of people in our
daily life and congregation activities, even as Jeremiah interacted with those around him. This all relates
to what we might learn from Jeremiah, who, similar
to the prophet Elijah, was “a man with feelings like
ours.” (Jas. 5:17) Consider some examples of what we
can learn from Jeremiah.
13

Over the years, have you not had ups and downs?

So did Jeremiah. On one occasion Pashhur, a prominent priest, assaulted Jeremiah and had him put in
stocks. For hours, he was con?ned in a wooden frame
that may have held his feet, hands, and neck, forcing
him into a distorted posture. In addition to the pain,
he must have had to endure ridicule heaped on him
by opposers. Do you think that you could bear up un12. What are some reasons why we can identify with Jeremiah?

Pashhur?
12

der malicious ridicule, even physical mistreatment?
—Jer. 20:1-4.
14

Given Jeremiah’s situation, it is not surprising

that he felt moved to say: “Cursed be the day on
which I was born! . . . Why is it that I have come forth
from the very womb in order to see hard work and
grief and that my days should come to their end in
mere shame?” (Jer. 20:14-18) Clearly, he knew what
despair was. Have you ever felt so despondent that
you doubted your worth, what you were accomplishing, or even whether there was much point in going
on? All who have ever had such feelings can bene?t
from a better understanding of Jeremiah’s experiences and of how things worked out for him.
What impresses you about Jehovah’s commissioning of
Jeremiah? Why can you identify with Jeremiah?
15

The expressions of despair that we read at Jeremi-

ah 20:14-18 follow right after the prophet spoke about
singing to Jehovah and praising him. (Read Jeremiah 20:
12, 13.) In your case, have you at times noted rather

experienced?

13

quick changes in your emotions? You were very happy,
and then your mood changed to one of discouragement.
Likely all of us can pro?t from analyzing Jeremiah’s experience. It is clear that he had normal human feelings,
as do we. So we can probably bene?t greatly from examining the actions and reactions of this man whom
the Creator was able to use mightily as a spokesman.
—2 Chron. 36:12, 21, 22; Ezra 1:1.
16

Another reason why some identify with Jeremiah

relates to his marital status. What was it? God gave
Jeremiah an unusual and perhaps challenging direction: Do not marry. (Read Jeremiah 16:2.) Why did Jehovah tell Jeremiah that, and how did it a?ect him?
What is there in this account that might resonate
with brothers and sisters who do not have a mate,
whether by choice or because of circumstances? In
fact, is there something in God’s statement to Jeremiah that Witnesses who are now married should ponder? And what of married couples who do not have
“sons and daughters”? How can the account of Jeremiah help you?
16. Jeremiah’s marital status may be noteworthy to whom?

17

It is interesting that at one point Jeremiah urged

the reigning Judean king: “Obey, please, the voice of
Jehovah in what I am speaking to you, and it will go
well with you, and your soul will continue to live.”
(Jer. 38:20) This account o?ers excellent guidance
about our interaction with others. That includes dealings with people who are not yet walking in Jehovah’s
ways but whom we may be able to help. Also, Jeremiah’s actions toward those who were obeying God is a
practical pattern for us today. Yes, we can learn a
great deal from Jeremiah.
WHAT IS TO COME?
18

This volume will help you to examine the Bible

books of Jeremiah and Lamentations and to learn
from them. How? Under inspiration, the apostle Paul
wrote: “All Scripture is inspired of God and bene?cial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things
straight, for disciplining in righteousness.” (2 Tim. 3:
16) That includes the two books just mentioned.
17. The prophet’s words found at Jeremiah 38:20 may cause us to think
of what?
18, 19. What are some ways in which the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations could be considered?
“I Have Put My Words in Your Mouth”

15

19

Of course, the books of Jeremiah and Lamen-

tations could be approached bene?cially in various
ways. For instance, one might study those two books
verse by verse, seeking to understand the background
or import of each verse. Or one could concentrate on
valid parallels—individuals and events described in
Jeremiah and Lamentations set alongside or contrasted with modern equivalents or developments. (Compare Jeremiah 24:6, 7; 1 Corinthians 3:6.) Another
mode might be to study the historical setting and
events illuminated by these two books. (Jer. 39:1-9)
In fact, to an extent, some of such information is necessary for any rewarding examination of Jeremiah
and Lamentations. Thus, Chapter 2, “Serving in ‘the
Final Part of the Days,’ ” will help us to get an overview of what the historical period that Jeremiah lived
through was like and how God’s guiding hand came
into play.
20

But the main thrust of this volume is di?erent.

We will approach the books of Jeremiah and Lamen20. What approach to the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations will we

tations as gifts from God to help us live as Christians
today. (Titus 2:12) We will realize even more than
ever that these two books contain abundant information that is “bene?cial for teaching.” They o?er practical advice and examples that can enable us to be
competent and equipped as we face life’s challenges.
That is the case whether we are single, married, elders, pioneers, breadwinners, housewives, or students
at school. Each of us will discover in these two inspired books divine help to be “equipped for every
good work.”—2 Tim. 3:17.
21

As you consider each chapter in this volume, look

for points that you can use. There is no doubt that
the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations will underscore what Paul wrote: “All the things that were
written aforetime were written for our instruction,
that through our endurance and through the comfort
from the Scriptures we might have hope.”—Rom.
15:4.

CHAPTER TWO

S ERVING IN “THE
F INAL PART OF THE DAYS ”
“WHAT are you seeing?” God asked his newly commissioned prophet. “A widemouthed cooking pot
blown upon is what I am seeing,” answered young Jeremiah, “and its mouth is away from the north.” That
vision gave an early indication of the sort of declaration that Jeremiah would make. (Read Jeremiah 1:
13-16.) The ?gurative cooking pot was being blown
upon, not to cool it, but to intensify the ?ames underneath. Yes, Jehovah was foretelling that trouble,
like a scalding liquid, would pour from this pot onto
the land of Judah because of the prevailing unfaithfulness. Why do you think the pot’s mouth was tilted
southward? It meant that trouble would come from
the north—Babylon would invade from that direction. And so it proved to be. During his years as a
prophet, Jeremiah witnessed successive outpourings

from this boiling cooking pot, culminating in the destruction of Jerusalem.
2

Babylon is no more, but you have reason to be in-

terested in Jeremiah’s prophetic messages. Why? Because you live in “the ?nal part of the days” when
many claim that they are Christians; yet they and
their churches do not have God’s favor. (Jer. 23:20)
In contrast, like Jeremiah, you and your fellow Witnesses are preaching a message not only of judgment
but also of hope.
3

Jeremiah likely dictated his account to a secretary

in the latter part of his prophetic career, rather than
recording events as they happened. (Jer. 25:1-3; 36:1,
4, 32) The book is not in chronological order because
Jeremiah arranged many parts of it according to subject. Thus, you should ?nd it useful to get an overview
of the historical backdrop of the books of Jeremiah
and Lamentations and the order in which events occurred. Note the chart on page 21. Your knowing who

JEREMIAH IN HIS HISTORICAL SETTING
4

Jeremiah prophesied during a period of turbulent

changes. It was a time of rivalry between Assyria,
Babylon, and Egypt. Some 93 years before the start
of Jeremiah’s prophetic career, Assyria defeated the
northern ten-tribe kingdom of Israel and deported
many of its inhabitants. At that time, Jehovah defended Jerusalem and its faithful king, Hezekiah, against
Assyrian assault. You will recall how God miraculously slew 185,000 enemy soldiers. (2 Ki. 19:32-36)
One of Hezekiah’s sons was Manasseh. Jeremiah was
likely born during Manasseh’s 55-year reign, a time
when Judah came under Assyrian political control.
—2 Chron. 33:10, 11.
5

Jeremiah wrote the books of 1 and 2 Kings,

in which we read that Manasseh rebuilt the high

Jerusalem and Judah, as

continued his father’s idol-

590

atrous practices, but soon
580

things would change. After two years, Amon was murdered, and his eight-year-old son Josiah came to the
throne in 659 B.C.E.
6

During Josiah’s 31-year reign, Babylon began to

gain the upper hand over Assyria. Josiah saw in
this situation an opening to regain Judah’s independence from foreign domination. Unlike his father and
grandfather, Josiah served Jehovah faithfully and instituted major religious reforms. (2 Ki. 21:19–22:2)
In his 12th year as king, Josiah destroyed the high
places, the sacred poles, and the false religious images throughout his kingdom and thereafter ordered
that Jehovah’s temple be repaired. (Read 2 Chronicles
34:1-8.) Interestingly, it was in the 13th year of Josiah’s reign (647 B.C.E.) that Jeremiah was commissioned as God’s prophet.
How might you have felt had you been a prophet in
Jeremiah’s day?

found “the very book of the law.” The king had his
secretary read it to him. Josiah recognized the errors
of his people, sought Jehovah’s guidance through the
prophetess Huldah, and urged his subjects to keep
God’s commandments. Huldah informed Josiah that
Jehovah would bring “calamity” on the Judeans on
account of their unfaithfulness. However, because of
Josiah’s good attitude toward pure worship, that calamity would not come during his lifetime.—2 Ki.
22:8, 14-20.
8

King Josiah renewed his e?orts to eliminate all

the trappings of idolatry. This drive even took him
into territory once occupied by the northern kingdom
of Israel, to pull down the high place and the altar at
Bethel. He also arranged for an outstanding celebration of the Passover. (2 Ki. 23:4-25) Think how
this must have pleased Jeremiah! It proved di?cult,
though, to move the people to change their ways. Manasseh and Amon had introduced the people to degraded idol worship, so spirituality was at a low ebb.
Despite Josiah’s reforms, God moved Jeremiah to
point out that the Judeans’ gods were as many as

their cities. The prophet’s fellow countrymen were
like an unfaithful wife—they had left Jehovah and
prostituted themselves to foreign gods. Jeremiah declared: “As many altars as the streets of Jerusalem
you people have placed for the shameful thing, altars
to make sacri?cial smoke to Baal.”—Read Jeremiah 11:
1-3, 13.

Just as Jeremiah’s delivering of such messages did

not change the Jews, so it did not alter the fact that
surrounding nations were jostling to gain ascendancy. In 632 B.C.E., the combined forces of the Babylonians and the Medes conquered Nineveh, the Assyrian capital. Three years later, Pharaoh Necho of Egypt
led his army north to assist the beleaguered Assyrians. For reasons not stated in the Bible, Josiah tried
to turn the Egyptian forces back at Megiddo, but he
was mortally wounded. (2 Chron. 35:20-24) What political and religious changes would this sad event
bring to Judah? And what new challenges would Jeremiah face?

JOSIAH—THE LAST OF JUDAH’S
GOOD KINGS
Upon the death of his father, Amon, Josiah became king of Judah at age eight. When he was
15, he began to search for God and “to walk in
all the way of David his forefather.” When he was
19, he began to cleanse Judah and Israel of their
places of false worship and to smash their idols.
At age 25, he began to have Jehovah’s temple repaired.—2 Ki. 21:19–22:2; 2 Chron. 34:2-8.
The book of the Law, likely the original written
by Moses, was found during the temple restoration and was read to Josiah. He humbled himself,
tore his garments, and wept. Josiah arranged for
the priests, the Levites, and all his subjects, the
great and the small, to hear the reading of the
book. The king concluded a covenant, says the
account, “to go following Jehovah and to keep
his commandments . . . with all his heart and
with all his soul.” Thereafter, Josiah undertook a
more extensive campaign to eliminate false worship. The king also held a great Passover to Jehovah, the like of which had not been seen since the
days of Samuel.—2 Chron. 34:14 –35:19.

A CHANGE OF RELIGIOUS CLIMATE
10

Imagine how Jeremiah must have felt on learning

of Josiah’s death! Moved with grief, he chanted dirges
over the king. (2 Chron. 35:25) This was already a
time of worry, and international instability brought
pressure on Judah. The rival powers—Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon—were jockeying for control of the region. And the religious climate within Judah had
changed with Josiah’s death. That was the end of a
regime essentially favorable toward Jeremiah’s activity and the beginning of a hostile one. Many of our
brothers in modern times have experienced a similar
change, from relative freedom of worship to persecutions and bans. Who knows how many of us might
soon experience similar changes? How might that affect us? What might we have to do to maintain our
integrity? With those questions in mind, it will be encouraging to note the challenges that Jeremiah met
successfully.

11

The inhabitants of Judah put Josiah’s son Jehoa-

haz on the throne in Jerusalem. Jehoahaz, also known
as Shallum, reigned for just three months. When Pharaoh Necho returned south after ?ghting the Babylonians, he removed the new king and took him to
Egypt, and Jeremiah declared that Jehoahaz would
“return no more.” (Jer. 22:10-12; 2 Chron. 36:1-4) In
his place, Necho enthroned Jehoiakim, another of Josiah’s sons. Jehoiakim did not imitate his father’s
good example. Far from continuing his father’s reforms, he practiced idolatry.—Read 2 Kings 23:36, 37.
12

At the start of Jehoiakim’s reign, Jehovah told

Jeremiah to go to the temple and roundly condemn
the Judeans for their wickedness. They considered Jehovah’s temple to be a talisman that would protect
them. Yet, if they would not abandon their “stealing, murdering and committing adultery and swearing falsely and making sacri?cial smoke to Baal and
walking after other gods,” Jehovah would forsake his

temple. And he would do the same to the hypocrites
who worshipped in it, just as he abandoned the tabernacle at Shiloh in the days of High Priest Eli. The
land of Judah would “become nothing but a devastated place.” (Jer. 7:1-15, 34; 26:1-6)1 Think of the courage Jeremiah needed to declare that message! Likely,
he did so in public before prominent, in?uential people. Some brothers and sisters today have likewise felt
that they needed a measure of courage to share in
street witnessing or to address wealthy or important
people. We can, though, be sure of this: God’s support for us is certain, just as it was for Jeremiah.
—Heb. 10:39; 13:6.
13

Given the religious and political climate prevail-

ing in Judah, how would the religious leaders react to
Jeremiah’s speech? According to the prophet’s own
account, “the priests and the prophets and all the
people laid hold of [me], saying: ‘You will positively
die.’ ” They were livid, declaring: “To this man the
judgment of death belongs.” (Read Jeremiah 26:8-11.)
Jeremiah’s opponents, however, did not prevail. Jeho1 The similarity between Jeremiah 7:1-15 and 26:1-6 has led some to
conclude that both passages refer to the same event.

menacing appearance or numbers to frighten him.
Neither should you.
How would you contrast conditions during the reigns of
Manasseh, Amon, and Josiah? What lesson might you ?nd
in how Jeremiah faced his challenging assignment?
“YOU MUST WRITE . . . ALL THE WORDS”
14

In the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim, Je-

hovah told Jeremiah to write down all the words that
Jehovah had spoken to him since the days of Josiah.
Jeremiah thus dictated to his secretary, Baruch, all
that God had told him in the preceding 23 years. His
messages of judgment involved some 20 kings and
kingdoms. Jeremiah commanded Baruch to read this
scroll aloud in Jehovah’s house. The objective of this
e?ort? “Perhaps those of the house of Judah will
listen to all the calamity that I am thinking of doing
to them,” said Jehovah, “to the end that they may return, each one from his bad way, and that I may

actually forgive their error and their sin.”—Jer. 25:
1-3; 36:1-3.
15

When a court o?cial read the scroll to Jehoiakim,

the king cut it up and burned it. He then ordered that
Jeremiah and Baruch be brought before him. “But Jehovah kept them concealed.” (Read Jeremiah 36:21-26.)
Because of Jehoiakim’s thoroughly bad attitude, Jehovah, through his prophet, declared that the king
would have “the burial of a he-ass.” He would be
‘dragged about and thrown away, out beyond the
gates of Jerusalem.’ (Jer. 22:13-19) Do you think that
this graphic prophecy could be dismissed as an exaggeration on Jeremiah’s part?
16

Despite having to deliver such messages of judg-

ment, Jeremiah was not a prophet of doom. He also
announced a message of hope. Jehovah would deliver a remnant of Israel from their enemies and restore
them to their own land, where they would dwell in security. God would establish “a new” and “inde?nitely lasting covenant” with his people and write his law
in their heart. He would forgive their errors and re16. Jeremiah proclaimed what positive message?

JEHOIAKIM—THE KING WHO
KILLED JEHOVAH’S PROPHET
Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he came
to the throne of Judah, and he reigned about
11 years. The summary of his acts recorded at
2 Chronicles 36:5-8 notes that he did, not just
bad, but “detestable things.” Ignoring Jeremiah’s warnings, Jehoiakim ruled by injustice,
extortion, and murder. When Urijah the prophet spoke a message similar to Jeremiah’s, Jehoiakim had him murdered. It appears that the king
himself died during the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem.—Jer. 22:17-19; 26:20-23.
member their sins no more. Moreover, a descendant
of David would “execute justice and righteousness in
the land.” (Jer. 31:7-9; 32:37-41; 33:15) These prophecies were to have their ful?llment in the decades and
centuries to come, even a ful?llment that touches our
lives and can brighten our everlasting future. But
back in Jeremiah’s day, Judah’s enemies continued
their maneuvers.—Read Jeremiah 31:31, 33, 34; Hebrews
8:7-9; 10:14-18.

THE RISE OF BABYLON
17

In 625 B.C.E., the Babylonians and Egyptians

fought a decisive battle at Carchemish, near the
Euphrates River some 370 miles north of Jerusalem. King Nebuchadnezzar vanquished Pharaoh Necho’s forces, ending Egyptian power in the region.
(Jer. 46:2) Nebuchadnezzar now dominated Judah,
and Jehoiakim was forced to be his servant. After
three years of vassalage, however, Jehoiakim rebelled.
(2 Ki. 24:1, 2) In response, Nebuchadnezzar and his
army marched into Judah in 618 B.C.E. and surrounded Jerusalem. Try to picture how turbulent a time
that was, even for God’s prophet Jeremiah. Jehoiakim
apparently met his end during the siege.1 His son Jehoiachin surrendered to the Babylonians after occupying Judah’s throne for just three months. Nebuchadnezzar stripped Jerusalem of its riches and took
1 Daniel 1:1, 2 says that Jehoiakim was given into Nebuchadnezzar’s
hand in Jehoiakim’s third year, apparently of his vassalage. This may
mean that the king died during the siege, which ultimately succeeded.
There is no Biblical con?rmation of Josephus’ report that Nebuchadnezzar killed Jehoiakim and had his body thrown outside Jerusalem’s
walls without a burial.—Jer. 22:18, 19; 36:30.

reign and that of Zedekiah?

into exile Jehoiachin, the families of the king and of
the nobles of Judah, the nation’s mighty men, and its
craftsmen. Among the exiles were Daniel, Hananiah,
Mishael, and Azariah.—2 Ki. 24:10-16; Dan. 1:1-7.
18

Nebuchadnezzar now made Zedekiah, another of

Josiah’s sons, king of Judah. He was to be the last
earthly king of the Davidic line. His reign ended
when Jerusalem and its temple were destroyed in
607 B.C.E. (2 Ki. 24:17) The 11 years of Zedekiah’s
reign, though, were marked by great social and political tensions in Judah. Clearly, Jeremiah had to trust
implicitly in the One who had commissioned him as
a prophet.
19

Put yourself in Jeremiah’s place. Since Josiah’s

time, Jeremiah had seen political upheaval and spiritual deterioration among God’s people. However, he
knew that things would get worse. The people of his
hometown told him: “You must not prophesy in the
name of Jehovah, that you may not die at our hand.”
(Jer. 11:21) Even when Jeremiah’s prophecies came

true, the Jews said: “As regards the word that you
have spoken to us in the name of Jehovah, we are not
listening to you.” (Jer. 44:16) Yet, people’s lives were
at stake, just as they are today. The message you proclaim is from Jehovah, just as Jeremiah’s was. That
being the case, you can fortify your zeal for the ministry by examining how Jehovah protected his prophet during the period leading up to Jerusalem’s fall.
What can we learn from Jeremiah’s attitude during
Jehoiakim’s reign? Jeremiah pronounced what outstanding
prophecy that reaches our time?
THE CLO SING DAYS OF A DYNASTY
20

Perhaps the hardest years of Jeremiah’s prophet-

ic career were during Zedekiah’s reign. Like many of
his predecessors, Zedekiah “continued to do what
was bad in the eyes of Jehovah.” (Jer. 52:1, 2) He
was a subject of the Babylonians, and Nebuchadnezzar made him take an oath in Jehovah’s name that
obliged him to submit to the king of Babylon. Despite
that, Zedekiah eventually rebelled. Meanwhile, Jere20. Why was Zedekiah’s reign particularly di?cult for Jeremiah? (See

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

ZEDEKIAH—THE LAST EARTHLY
KING OF JUDAH
Zedekiah was a spineless, vacillating ruler
dominated by his princes and his own fears.
During the ?nal Babylonian siege of Jerusalem,
Zedekiah sought God’s guidance from Jeremiah. Yet, the king failed to act in harmony with it
when told to surrender. Because he did not like
Jeremiah’s message, Zedekiah imprisoned him.
(Jer. 21:1-9; 32:1-5) Nonetheless, the king continued to consult Jeremiah but in secret so as not to
upset Judah’s princes. When they sought Jeremiah’s death, Zedekiah weakly acquiesced, saying:
“He is in your hands. For there is nothing at all in
which the king himself can prevail against you.”
After Jeremiah was released from the threat of
death, the king again consulted him and admitted that he feared that if he obeyed God, the people would mistreat him.—Jer. 37:15-17; 38:4, 5,
14-19, 24-26.
Still, Zedekiah “did not humble himself on account of Jeremiah . . . , and he kept sti?ening his
neck and hardening his heart so as not to return
to Jehovah.”—2 Chron. 36:12, 13; Ezek. 21:25.
Serving in “the Final Part of the Days”

35

miah’s enemies exerted great pressure on him to support the rebellion.—2 Chron. 36:13; Ezek. 17:12, 13.
21

Evidently early in the reign of Zedekiah, messen-

gers arrived in Jerusalem from the kings of Edom,
Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon. Perhaps their aim
was to get Zedekiah to join a coalition against Nebuchadnezzar. Jeremiah, however, urged Zedekiah to
submit to Babylon. In line with that, Jeremiah presented the messengers with yoke bars to picture that
their nations too should serve the Babylonians. (Jer.
27:1-3, 14)1 That stance was not popular, and Jeremiah’s role as a spokesman with an unpopular message
was made no easier by Hananiah. He was a false
prophet who publicly asserted in God’s name that the
Babylonian yoke would be broken. Jehovah’s word
through Jeremiah, however, was that within a year,
the impostor Hananiah would die. That is what occurred.—Jer. 28:1-3, 16, 17.
1 The reference to Jehoiakim at Jeremiah 27:1 may be a transcriber’s
error because verses 3 and 12 refer to Zedekiah.

36

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

22

Judah was now split into opposing factions

—those who favored submission to Babylon and
those who urged rebellion. In 609 B.C.E., Zedekiah
did rebel by seeking military assistance from Egypt.
Jeremiah then had to contend with the nationalistic hysteria of those supporting the rebellion. (Jer.
52:3; Ezek. 17:15) Nebuchadnezzar and his armies returned to Judah to quell the revolt, conquering all the
cities of Judah and again besieging Jerusalem. Jeremiah’s message to Zedekiah and his subjects at this
critical time was that Jerusalem would fall to the Babylonians. Death awaited those who remained in the
city. Those who went out to the Chaldeans would survive.—Read Jeremiah 21:8-10; 52:4.
23

The princes of Judah claimed that Jeremiah was

throwing in his lot with the Babylonians. When he
stated the truth, the Judean princes struck him and
put him in the house of detention. (Jer. 37:13-15) Jeremiah would still not soften Jehovah’s message. Therefore, the princes persuaded Zedekiah to put Jeremiah to death. They put the prophet into an empty

37

water cistern where he could have perished in the
deep mire. But Ebed-melech, an Ethiopian serving in
the king’s house, rescued Jeremiah. (Jer. 38:4-13) How
often Jehovah’s people in modern times have faced
perils because of their conscientious refusal to get involved in political controversies! Clearly, Jeremiah’s
experience can fortify you to face trials and overcome
them.
24

In 607 B.C.E., the Babylonians ?nally broke

through Jerusalem’s walls, and the city fell. Nebuchadnezzar’s forces burned Jehovah’s temple, demolished the city walls, and slaughtered the nobles of Judah. Zedekiah attempted to ?ee, only to be captured
and brought before his conqueror. Zedekiah’s sons
were slaughtered before his eyes, and then Nebuchadnezzar had him blinded, bound, and led away to Babylon. (Jer. 39:1-7) Yes, Jeremiah’s words regarding
Judah and Jerusalem had come true. Rather than rejoice, God’s prophet mourned the calamity of his
people. We can read his sentiments in the Bible book

of Lamentations. We should be deeply touched as we
read that book.
ACTIVITY AMONG A REMNANT OF JUDAH
25

What was happening to Jeremiah as these dra-

matic events unfolded? The princes of Jerusalem
had imprisoned him, but the conquering Babylonians
treated him kindly, freeing him. Later, Jeremiah got
mixed in with some Jews being taken o? into captivity, but he was released. There was yet more for him
to do in God’s service; he still had work to do among
the survivors. Nebuchadnezzar appointed Gedaliah
as governor over the conquered land, promising the
remaining Judeans peace as long as they served him,
the king of Babylon. Some malcontent Jews, however,
assassinated Gedaliah. (Jer. 39:13, 14; 40:1-7; 41:2) Jeremiah urged the remnant of Judeans to keep dwelling in the land and not to fear the king of Babylon.
Their leaders, however, called Jeremiah a liar and
?ed to Egypt, forcibly taking along Jeremiah and

Baruch. Yet, Jeremiah prophesied that Nebuchadnezzar would invade and subdue even that country and
bring calamity on the Judean refugees.—Jer. 42:9-11;
43:1-11; 44:11-13.
26

Once again, the response of Jeremiah’s fellow

countrymen was not to listen to God’s true prophet.
Why? “From the time that we ceased to make sacri?cial smoke to the ‘queen of the heavens’ and pour
out drink o?erings to her,” they reasoned, “we have
lacked everything, and by the sword and by the famine we have come to our ?nish.” (Jer. 44:16, 18) What
a sad re?ection of the spiritual state of Jeremiah’s
contemporaries! On the other hand, how encouraging
it should be to us to know that an imperfect human
can remain faithful to Jehovah despite being surrounded by the faithless!
27

The last event that Jeremiah recorded—the re-

lease from prison of Jehoiachin at the hands of
Nebuchadnezzar’s successor, Evil-merodach—is dated 580 B.C.E. (Jer. 52:31-34) By this time, Jeremiah

must have been about 90 years old. We have no reliable information concerning the end of his life. It is
likely that he lived out his ?nal years in Egypt and
died faithful there after some 67 years in special service to Jehovah. He served during years when true
worship was promoted as well as during many years
when apostate worship was all around him. He did
?nd listening ears among some God-fearing people.
The majority, though, rejected his messages, even displaying outright hostility. Did that make Jeremiah a
failure? Far from it! Right from the beginning, Jehovah had told him: “They will be certain to ?ght
against you, but they will not prevail against you, for
‘I am with you.’ ” (Jer. 1:19) Our commission as Jehovah’s Witnesses today is like that of Jeremiah. So we
can expect the reception to be similar. (Read Matthew
10:16-22.) Therefore, what lessons can we learn from
Jeremiah, and how should we approach our ministry?

CHAPTER THREE

“YOU M UST S AY TO T HEM
T HIS WORD ”
JESUS CHRIST is the chief model whom we follow
in preaching the good news. It is noteworthy, though,
that people in the ?rst century who observed Jesus
sometimes thought of the prophet Jeremiah. (Matt.
16:13, 14) As was true of Jesus, Jeremiah received a
divine command to preach. For example, on one occasion God told him: “You must say to them this
word, ‘This is what Jehovah . . . has said.’ ” (Jer. 13:
12, 13; John 12:49) And in his ministry Jeremiah displayed qualities similar to those of Jesus.
2

However, some Witnesses might say: ‘Our preach-

ing work is di?erent from that of Jeremiah. He was
God’s spokesman to a nation that was dedicated to
Him, while most of those to whom we preach do not

know Jehovah.’ That is true. But by Jeremiah’s time,
most Jews had become “unwise” and had left the true
God. (Read Jeremiah 5:20-22.) They needed to change
to worship Jehovah acceptably. Similarly, people today—whether claiming to be Christian or not—need
to learn to fear Jehovah and pursue true worship. Let
us see how we can serve the true God and help people by imitating Jeremiah.
‘JEHOVAH TOUCHED MY MOUTH’
3

Recall that at the start of his prophetic ministry,

Jeremiah heard these words: “To all those to whom I
shall send you, you should go; and everything that I
shall command you, you should speak. Do not be
afraid because of their faces, for ‘I am with you to
deliver you,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.” (Jer. 1:7, 8)
And then God made an unexpected gesture. Jeremiah tells us: “Jehovah thrust his hand out and caused
it to touch my mouth. Then Jehovah said to me:
‘Here I have put my words in your mouth. See, I have
commissioned you this day.’ ” (Jer. 1:9, 10) From then

43

on, Jeremiah knew that he spoke for Almighty God.1
With His full support, Jeremiah’s zeal for sacred service grew.—Isa. 6:5-8.
4

Jehovah does not physically touch any of his ser-

vants today. Yet, through his spirit, he does give
them a strong desire to preach the good news. Many
of them glow with zeal. Take the case of Maruja in
Spain. For over 40 years, her arms and legs have been
paralyzed. Preaching from door to door is di?cult
for her, so she ?nds other ways to be active in the
ministry. One way is by writing letters. Maruja dictates the words to her daughter, who writes them
down. During a month-long campaign, Maruja and
her “secretary” sent out over 150 letters, enclosing a
copy of a tract in each envelope. Through their efforts, the good news reached most of the homes in a
nearby village. Maruja commented to her daughter,
“If one of our letters gets into the hands of a person
with an upright heart, Jehovah will bless us with a

Bible study.” A local elder writes, “I thank Jehovah
for sisters like Maruja, who teach others to value
what is really important.”
5

In Jeremiah’s time, most of Jerusalem’s inhab-

itants took “no delight” in God’s truth. Did the
prophet stop preaching because so many were apathetic about the message? On the contrary! Jeremiah
said: “With the rage of Jehovah I have become full. I
have become weary with holding in.” (Jer. 6:10, 11)
How can you maintain zeal like that? One way is to
meditate on the incomparable privilege you have of
representing the true God. You know that prominent
ones in this world have reproached the name of the
true God. Think, too, of how religious leaders have
deceived the people of your territory, even as the
priests did in Jeremiah’s day. (Read Jeremiah 2:8, 26,
27.) In contrast, the good news of God’s Kingdom
that you declare is really an expression of God’s favor toward humanity. (Lam. 3:31, 32) Yes, re?ecting

on such truth can help you maintain your zeal for
declaring the good news and helping sheeplike ones.
6

You will likely agree that maintaining zeal in the

Christian ministry is not always easy. As he served
Jehovah, Jeremiah too met with serious challenges,
including false prophets. You can read of one instance in Jeremiah chapter 28. Most of the people
paid no heed to his message, and sometimes he felt
rather isolated. (Jer. 6:16, 17; 15:17) Moreover, on occasion he had to cope with enemies who threatened
his life.—Jer. 26:11.

Why can you trust Jehovah to help you overcome challenges
as you preach the good news?
“YOU HAVE FO OLED ME, O JEHOVAH”
7

During one period when Jeremiah faced mockery

and insults day after day, he expressed his feelings to
God. In what sense, do you think, can you say that
Jehovah “fooled” his faithful prophet, as mentioned
at Jeremiah 20:7, 8?—Read.
7, 8. In what bene?cial way did God ‘fool’ Jeremiah?
46

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

8

Jehovah had de?nitely not tricked or deceived Jer-

emiah by using some crafty, underhanded scheme
against him. Rather, God “fooled” his prophet in a
positive, bene?cial sense. Jeremiah felt that the opposition was too great, that by himself he could no
longer ful?ll his God-given assignment. But ful?ll it
he did, with the Almighty’s support and help. Hence,
you might say that Jehovah overpowered him, proving far stronger than Jeremiah and his human inclinations. When this man of God thought that he had
reached his limit and could not keep going, Jehovah
exercised a persuasive force so that Jeremiah was
fooled, as it were. God proved stronger than the
prophet’s weaknesses. Even in the face of apathy, rejection, and violence, Jeremiah was able to continue
to preach.
9

Jehovah proved to be like “a terrible mighty one”

alongside Jeremiah, supporting him. (Jer. 20:11) And
God can strengthen you too so that you keep your
zeal for true worship and carry on despite major
problems. You might think of it as it is expressed

The apostle Paul underscored that point when

encouraging Christians who faced opposition. He
wrote: “Behave in a manner worthy of the good news
about the Christ, in order that . . . I may hear . . . that
you are standing ?rm in one spirit, with one soul
striving side by side for the faith of the good news,
and in no respect being frightened by your opponents.” (Phil. 1:27, 28) As did Jeremiah and Christians in the ?rst century, you can and should lean on
Almighty God as you carry out your ministry. If
some people deride or attack you, remember that Jehovah is at your side and can ?ll you with power. He
did so for Jeremiah and has done so for many of your
brothers; hence, he can do so for you. Supplicate him
for help, and trust that he will respond to your

What we read of Jeremiah’s service can help us

in various ways to be more e?ective ministers of the
good news. After he had served as Jehovah’s prophet for over 20 years, he was able to say: “I kept speaking to you people, rising up early and speaking, but
you did not listen.” (Jer. 25:3) Yes, he got an early
start rather than a late one. Can we learn something
practical from his example? In many congregations,
there are publishers who rise early to speak with people at bus stops and train stations. In rural areas,
many Witnesses use the early hours of the day to visit farmers and others who are active at that time. Can
you think of other ways that you personally can apply this lesson from Jeremiah’s faithful ministry?
What about getting up su?ciently early to be present
right at the start of a scheduled meeting for ?eld service?

people in your ministry?

Moreover, preaching from door to door in the af-

ternoon and evening often produces excellent results
in many localities. Some publishers even preach at
night, visiting workers at gas stations, restaurants,
and other businesses that are open 24 hours a day.
Can you adjust your schedule so that you can preach
when you are most likely to ?nd people at home or
elsewhere?
Why do you feel con?dent that Jehovah is backing you as
you proclaim his message?
13

On occasion, Jehovah commanded Jeremiah to

announce prophetic messages while standing in the
gates of the temple or of Jerusalem. (Jer. 7:2; 17:19,
20) By making such declarations at the gates, Jeremiah reached large numbers of people with Jehovah’s
word. And since many, including prominent men of
the city, merchants, and businessmen, used the same
gate habitually, he may have spoken to some people
repeatedly in an e?ort to help them understand what

they had previously heard. What can we learn from
this about making return visits on those who have
shown interest?
14

Jeremiah knew that lives depended on his work

as God’s prophet. Once, when he could not carry out
divine instructions to speak with the people, he sent
his friend Baruch in his place. (Read Jeremiah 36:5-8.)
How can we imitate Jeremiah in this? When we tell
a householder that we will return, do we keep our
word? If we cannot keep an appointment for a return
visit or a home Bible study, do we arrange for a substitute? Jesus said: “Let your word Yes mean Yes.”
(Matt. 5:37) Keeping our word is essential, for we
represent the God of truth and order.—1 Cor. 14:
33, 40.
15

Jeremiah encouraged the Jews in Babylon by

writing them a letter about Jehovah’s “good word” of
restoration. (Jer. 29:1-4, 10) Today, the “good word”
of what Jehovah will soon do can also be e?ectively

methods to help your relatives or others who are in
faraway places or who are di?cult to contact?
16

By following Jeremiah’s example of fully accom-

plishing his ministry, Kingdom publishers today often obtain positive results. A Witness in Chile approached a woman exiting a subway station. She was
thrilled to hear the Bible’s message and agreed to a
Bible discussion at her home. The Witness, however,
did not write down the woman’s address. Afterward,
realizing the importance of cultivating the woman’s
interest in the truth, our sister prayed to Jehovah for
help. The next day, she returned to the subway station at the same hour. She met the woman again.
This time, she took care to write down her address
and later visited the woman at her home to help her
understand the Scriptures. God’s judgments are soon
to overtake Satan’s world. But there is hope for those
who repent and put faith in the good news. (Read
Lamentations 3:31-33.) Hence, let us re?ect that fact
by conscientiously working our territory.
52

“PERHAPS THEY WILL LISTEN AND
RETURN, EACH ONE”
17

Jehovah did not want people to lose their lives.

Some ten years before Jerusalem’s destruction, he
used Jeremiah to outline a hope for those exiled in
Babylon. We read: “I will set my eye upon them in a
good way, and I shall certainly cause them to return
to this land. And I will build them up, and I shall not
tear down; and I will plant them, and I shall not uproot.” Jeremiah could say to such ones: “There exists
a hope for your future.” (Jer. 24:6; 26:3; 31:17) Jeremiah made God’s view of people his own. He carried
out his ministry with genuine concern, conveying Jehovah’s urgings: “Turn back, please, each one from
his bad way, and make your dealings good.” (Jer. 35:
15) Can you think of additional ways to show deep
personal interest in people in your territory?

compassion for them. (Read Lamentations 2:11.) The
Jews had themselves to blame for their disaster. Jeremiah, however, did not say, ‘I told you so.’ Rather,
he felt great sadness for what had overtaken them.
Similarly, our ministry must not become perfunctory, done only out of obligation. Our e?orts at giving
a witness should prove how much we love our wonderful God as well as people, who are created in his
image.
19

No privilege or position in this world can surpass

that of witnessing on behalf of the true God. Jeremiah felt that way, writing: “Your words were found,
and I proceeded to eat them; and your word becomes
to me the exultation and the rejoicing of my heart;
for your name has been called upon me, O Jehovah.”
(Jer. 15:16) As we preach the good news, many more
may come to know and love the One to whom they
owe their lives. By serving with zeal and love, as
exempli?ed by Jeremiah, we will contribute to that
end.
Given Jeremiah’s example, what additional ways to spread
Jehovah’s “good word” might you try in the future?

G UARD AGAINST A
T REACHEROUS H EART
SUPPOSE that early one morning while still in bed,
you felt an acute pain in the middle of your chest
and had shortness of breath. You might wonder,
‘Could it be a heart attack?’ Just denying the problem would not help. Immediate action would be in
order. So you might call for an ambulance in order
to get expert medical care. A physician might carefully examine you, perhaps employing an electrocardiogram. Prompt diagnosis and treatment could
mean the di?erence between life and death.
2

How about our ?gurative heart? It may not be

easy to know its real condition. Why? We read in the
Bible: “The heart is more treacherous than anything
else and is desperate. Who can know it?” (Jer. 17:9)
So our heart can deceive us, leading us to believe
that no real spiritual problem exists, while others

55

may see warning signs and be concerned. Why might
we be deceived? Well, our sinful inclinations may
work against us, as Satan and this system of things
mask our real situation. As for examining our heart,
we can learn from Jeremiah and the people of Judah
in his day.
3

The majority of the Judeans had shown that their

hearts were spiritually defective. They left the only
true God for Canaanite gods, feeling no qualms of
conscience. Jehovah challenged those worshippers:
“Where are your gods that you have made for yourself? Let them rise up if they can save you in the
time of your calamity. For as the number of your
cities your gods have become.” (Jer. 2:28) In our
case, we certainly do not think of ourselves as worshippers of idol gods. However, under the heading
“god,” one dictionary says: “A person or thing of supreme value.” Many people in the world place ?rst
in life their career, health, family, and even pets.
Others consider sports, celebrities, technology, travel, or their traditions to be of supreme value. Many

pursue such things at the cost of their relationship
with the Creator. Could true Christians be a?ected,
even as were people of Judah in Jeremiah’s day?
TREACHEROUS HEARTS CAN DECEIVE
4

You will likely ?nd interesting the context of Jer-

emiah’s statement describing the heart as desperate.
He realized that people were saying: “Where is the
word of Jehovah? Let it come in, please.” (Jer. 17:15)
But were they sincere? Well, that chapter of Jeremiah opens this way: “The sin of Judah is written down
with an iron stylus. With a diamond point it is engraved on the tablet of their heart.” A key problem
was that those Judeans were ‘putting their trust in
earthling man, making ?esh their arm, and turning
their heart away from Jehovah.’ That was in contrast
to the minority, who trusted in God, looking to him
for guidance and blessings.—Jer. 17:1, 5, 7.
5

The hearts of the majority were revealed in their

reaction to what God said. (Read Jeremiah 17:21, 22.)
4. How sincere were the people who said: “Where is the word of Jehovah?
Let it come in”?
5. In what ways did Jeremiah’s countrymen respond to Jehovah’s direction?
Guard Against a Treacherous Heart

57

For example, the Sabbath was to be a rest from regular labor and an opportunity to share in spiritual
activities. Jeremiah’s countrymen were not to conduct business or run errands on the Sabbath. But
their response revealed the condition of their heart.
“They did not listen or incline their ear, and they
proceeded to harden their neck in order not to hear
and in order to receive no discipline.” Although they
knew God’s law, they had their own view—they had
things to do on the Sabbath.—Jer. 17:23; Isa. 58:13.
6

Today, we are not under Sabbath law. Yet, there

is a warning lesson in the way those people reacted,
showing their heart condition. (Col. 2:16) In order to
do God’s will, we have put aside our sel?sh or mundane pursuits. We realize how foolish it would be to
choose for ourselves a convenient way to please
God. And we have likely come to know many who
have concentrated on doing God’s will and have indeed found that to be refreshing, restful. Hence, how
might we be misled?

the faithful slave class today? (b) How might our meeting attendance be affected?
58

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

7

A Christian might mistakenly think that his

heart could never deceive him, as happened to many
in Jeremiah’s day. For example, a man might reason,
‘I have to hold down a job to support my family,’
which is understandable. What if that led him to
think, ‘I need more education to secure or hold a
decent job’? That too might seem logical, leading
him to conclude, ‘Times have changed, and to survive today you need to get a college or university education to hold on to your job.’ How easily
one might start to minimize the wise, balanced advice from the faithful and discreet slave class about
additional education and start to miss meetings! In
this area, some have gradually been molded by the
world’s reasonings and views. (Eph. 2:2, 3) The Bible aptly warns us: “Don’t let the world around you
squeeze you into its own mould.”—Rom. 12:2, Phillips.1
1 The NET Bible (2005) reads: “Do not be conformed to this present
world.” A footnote adds: “It is very telling that being ‘conformed’ to the
present world is viewed as a passive notion, for it may suggest that it
happens, in part, subconsciously. At the same time, . . . there may be
some consciousness of the conformity taking place. Most likely, it is a
combination of both.”
Guard Against a Treacherous Heart

59

8

Granted, some Christians in the ?rst centu-

ry had riches and perhaps a bit of prominence
in the world. That is true of some Christians
in our time too. How should they feel about
their accomplishments, and how should we view
such ones? Jehovah provided the answer through
Jeremiah. (Read Jeremiah 9:23, 24.) Rather than
bragging about human accomplishments, a person
is wise to acknowledge that knowing the Universal Sovereign is of chief value. (1 Cor. 1:31)
What, though, does it mean to have insight and
knowledge of Jehovah? Well, the people of Jeremiah’s day knew God’s name. They were also
aware of what he did in saving their ancestors at
the Red Sea, during the entry into the Promised Land, in the times of the Judges, and during the reigns of faithful kings. Nevertheless, they
did not really know Jehovah or exercise genuine
faith in him. Yet, they said: “I have remained

60

innocent. Surely [God’s] anger has turned back
from me.”—Jer. 2:35.
Why is it important to recognize that our heart is
treacherous? How can we examine our heart and learn how
the Great Examiner of hearts might view us?
THE WAY JEHOVAH MOLDS US
9

The Jews to whom Jeremiah delivered God’s mes-

sage needed a change of heart. That was possible because God said of those who would return from exile: “I will give them a heart to know me, that I am
Jehovah; and they must become my people, and I
myself shall become their God, for they will return
to me.” (Jer. 24:7) A similar change is possible today
too. Moreover, most of us can improve the condition
of our spiritual heart. Three things are vital: serious
personal study of God’s Word, insight into how God
works in our own life, and application of what we
have learned about him. Unlike those in Jeremiah’s
day, we should want to have our heart inspected by
the Great Examiner of hearts. And we can examine

come about?
Guard Against a Treacherous Heart

61

our own heart in the light of the Bible as well as by
noting how Jehovah has acted in our behalf. (Ps.
17:3) How wise it is to do so!
10

Satan wants to shape people by squeezing them

all into a certain mold, but molding by God takes individuals into account. We see this illustrated in Jeremiah’s experience. One day, God told him to go to
the house of a potter. The potter was working at
his wheel, but when the vessel he was forming was
spoiled, he simply molded the still-moist clay into a
di?erent vessel. (Read Jeremiah 18:1-4.) Why was Jeremiah directed to watch this, and what can we learn
from his experience?
11

Jehovah wanted to show Jeremiah and Israel

that He has authority to shape peoples and nations
into what He wants. How does God handle the clay?
Unlike human potters, Jehovah does not make mistakes; nor does he destroy the works of his hand on
a whim. How people respond to being molded by Jehovah determines what he does with them.—Read
Jeremiah 18:6-10.

how Jehovah molds people?
62

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

12

How, then, does Jehovah mold individuals? Fore-

most today, he uses the Bible. As a person reads and
responds to God’s Word, he reveals what kind of person he is, and God can mold him. Let us now consider the example of King Jehoiakim to see how
people in Jeremiah’s day might have been molded
in matters of daily life. The Law decreed that one
“must not defraud a hired laborer,” yet the king did
just that, exploiting fellow Israelites by using them
as a source of cheap labor to build “a roomy house.”
(Deut. 24:14; Jer. 22:13, 14, 17) God tried to mold Jehoiakim by means of His word delivered by the
prophets. Yet, the king followed the inclination of
his treacherous heart. He said, “I shall not obey” and
held to the way he had taken from his youth on.
Thus, God said: “With the burial of a he-ass [Jehoiakim] will be buried, with a dragging about and a
throwing away.” (Jer. 22:19, 21) How foolish it would
be for us to respond: ‘That is just how I am’! Today,
God is not sending prophets like Jeremiah, but He

does o?er guidance. The faithful and discreet slave
class helps us to see and apply Bible principles.
These may touch aspects of daily life, such as our
dress and grooming or the music and dancing linked
to a wedding or to another social event. Will we allow ourselves to be molded by God’s Word?
13

Consider another example. The Babylonians put

Zedekiah on the throne of Judah as a vassal king.
Then, contrary to God’s advice through Jeremiah,
Zedekiah rebelled. (Jer. 27:8, 12) So the Babylonians
besieged Jerusalem. The king and his princes felt
that they should do something to comply with the
Law to gain God’s favor. Aware that Hebrew slaves
were to be released in the seventh year of their bondage, Zedekiah concluded a covenant to liberate such
slaves. (Ex. 21:2; Jer. 34:14) Yes, with Jerusalem surrounded by enemies, it suddenly seemed advisable
for the people to free their slaves!—Read Jeremiah 34:
8-10.
14

Later, an Egyptian military force came to Jeru-

slaves? (b) What revealed the real heart condition of the slave owners?

salem’s aid, causing the Babylonians to lift the siege.
(Jer. 37:5) What would those who had freed their
slaves do? They forced back into servitude those
whom they had emancipated. (Jer. 34:11) The point
is that when they were in danger, the Jews seemed
to observe divine statutes, as if that could o?set
their former conduct. But when the danger subsided, they went back to their old ways. Despite their
pretense of accepting the spirit of the Law, their later actions revealed that at heart they did not want to
comply with direction found in God’s Word and be
molded by it.
What practical lesson can you take away from what
Jeremiah wrote about a potter? How does Jehovah
mold us today?
ACCEPT MOLDING BY JEHOVAH
15

With the help of Jehovah’s worldwide congrega-

tion, we may become aware of Bible principles that
deal with a speci?c course. For instance, we might
know how we ought to respond if a brother seems to
rub us the wrong way. (Eph. 4:32) We might admit
15. To what extent would you like to be molded by Jehovah? Illustrate.
Guard Against a Treacherous Heart

65

that the Bible’s counsel is right and wise. Yet, what
kind of clay will we prove to be? Will we really respond to being molded by Jehovah? If our heart is
malleable, we will change for the better; the Great
Potter will mold us into a vessel more suitable for
his use. (Read Romans 9:20, 21; 2 Timothy 2:20, 21.)
Rather than show a heart attitude like that of Jehoiakim or the slave owners in Zedekiah’s day, we
should accept being molded by Jehovah for an honorable purpose.
16

Even Jeremiah was molded by God. What was

the prophet’s attitude? You can tell from his admission: “It does not belong to man who is walking even
to direct his step.” He then pleaded: “Correct me,
O Jehovah.” (Jer. 10:23, 24) Young ones, will you imitate Jeremiah? You likely have many decisions ahead
of you. Some youths want to ‘direct their own step.’
Will you look to God for guidance when making decisions? Will you, like Jeremiah, humbly admit that
humans have proved incapable of directing their own

66

steps? Remember: If you seek God’s direction, he
will mold you.
17

Jeremiah’s assignment involved obedience to

God’s direction. If you had been Jeremiah, would
you have accepted any such instructions given? At
one point, Jehovah told Jeremiah to get a linen belt
and wear it. Next, God commanded him to travel to
the Euphrates. Consult a map, and you will see that
this meant a trip of some 300 miles. Once there, Jeremiah was to hide the belt in the cleft of a crag and
then travel all the way back to Jerusalem. And God
later had him return to get the belt. (Read Jeremiah
13:1-9.) In all, Jeremiah would have traveled about
1,200 miles. Bible critics just cannot believe that he
would travel so far, walking for months.1 (Ezra 7:9)
Still, that is what God said and what Jeremiah did.
18

Picture the prophet trekking through the Judean

mountains and then, depending on his route, into a

Euphrates. Why? “The sole object of this criticism,” states one scholar,
“is to save the prophet the labour of two supposed journeys from Jerusalem to the Euphrates.”

desert toward the Euphrates. All of that just to hide
a linen belt! His long absence must have aroused the
curiosity of his neighbors. When he returned, he did
not have the linen belt with him. Then God told him
to make the long trip again, to retrieve the belt, now
rotten and “not ?t for anything.” Imagine how easy
it would have been to think: ‘Now that is just too
much. I see no point to it.’ Yet, having been molded
by God, he did not react that way. Rather than complain, he did as he was instructed!
19

It was only after the second journey that God ex-

plained matters. Jeremiah’s actions set the stage for
him to deliver a potent message: “This bad people
who are refusing to obey my words, who are walking in the stubbornness of their heart and who keep
walking after other gods in order to serve them and
to bow down to them, will also become just like this
belt that is ?t for nothing.” (Jer. 13:10) What an impressive way for Jehovah to teach his people! Jeremiah’s heartfelt obedience to Jehovah in what may have
seemed trivial played a role in His e?orts to reach
the hearts of the people.—Jer. 13:11.

Christians today are not being asked to walk

hundreds of miles as part of a divine lesson. Might
it be, though, that the Christian course you pursue
could cause neighbors or associates to be puzzled or
even to criticize you? It may involve your dress and
grooming, your choice as to education, what you prefer as a career, or even your view of alcoholic beverages. Will you be as determined to comply with
God’s guidance as Jeremiah was? Your choices because of allowing your heart to be molded by God
may lead to your giving a ?ne witness. In any case,
being obedient to Jehovah’s direction found in his
Word and accepting the guidance given through the
faithful slave class is for your lasting good. Rather
than being led by a treacherous heart, you can be
like Jeremiah. Be resolved, then, to accept being
molded by God; let him form you into an honorable
vessel for his lasting use.

As we will see, Jeremiah often found himself

facing similar challenges. You can certainly bene?t
from considering some of the individuals and groups
with whom Jeremiah came in contact during his
years of service. Some of them tried to discourage
him from carrying out his commission. Jeremiah had
to have some close contact with them, but they
were de?nitely not his chosen friends. You can, how1, 2. (a) What challenges do Christians face regarding companions?

choose, those who supported him and encouraged
his resolve to be faithful. Yes, we can learn from Jeremiah’s decisions involving companions.
WHAT FRIENDSHIPS D O YOU CULTIVATE?
3

King Zedekiah consulted Jeremiah on a num-

ber of occasions prior to the destruction of Jerusalem. Why? The king hoped to receive reassuring responses to inquiries about the future of his
realm. He wanted Jeremiah to announce that divine
intervention would save Judah from her enemies.
Through emissaries, Zedekiah petitioned Jeremiah:
“Please inquire in our behalf of Jehovah, because
Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon is making war
against us. Perhaps Jehovah will do with us according to all his wonderful works, so that [Nebuchadrezzar] will withdraw from us.” (Jer. 21:2) The king
did not want to follow God’s direction to surrender
to Babylon. One scholar likened Zedekiah to “a patient returning again and again to a doctor in search

of reassurance, yet unwilling to take the medicine
prescribed.” What about Jeremiah? He could have
become popular by telling Zedekiah what he wanted to hear. Why, then, did Jeremiah not just change
his message and make his life easier? He refused to
do so because Jehovah had told him to proclaim that
Jerusalem would fall.—Read Jeremiah 32:1-5.
4

In some ways your situation is like Jeremiah’s. No

doubt you have contact with neighbors, workmates,
or schoolmates who in a sense are associates or companions. But will you take matters further, cultivating friendships with them even though they have
shown that they are not interested in hearing or following God’s direction? Jeremiah could not shun
Zedekiah altogether; he was still the king, even when
refusing to follow God’s counsel. Jeremiah was not
obliged, though, to conform to the king’s misguided
thinking or to curry his favor. Granted, if Jeremiah
had complied with the king’s wishes, Zedekiah could
have showered him with gifts and other bene?ts. Jer4. What decisions do we face about cultivating friendships, such as at our

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

When you read about Jeremiah and Ebedmelech, are you con?dent that they were real
people? Recently, the account in Jeremiah chapter 38 that mentions them gained added support
from two discoveries made in the ancient City of
David.
Archaeologist Eilat Mazar reports unearthing
a small clay seal impression, or bulla. It was
found in 2005 during a supervised excavation
of a layer dating back to when Jerusalem was
destroyed in 607 B.C.E. The seal bears the ancient Hebrew name “Yehuchal ben Shelemyahu,”
which is “Jucal the son of Shelemiah” in English.
Later, in a similar layer and just a few yards
away, another bulla was uncovered. It bears the
name “Gedalyahu ben Pashhur,” or “Gedaliah
the son of Pashhur.”
Now read at Jeremiah 38:1 the names of two
princes who urged King Zedekiah to have Jeremiah put to death, a plan that Ebed-melech
thwarted. Yes, those named in Jeremiah chapter 38 were real people.
emiah nevertheless refused to give in to any pressure
or temptation to be close to Zedekiah. Why? Because

73

Jeremiah was not about to alter the stance that Jehovah had told him to adopt. Jeremiah’s example
should move us to examine whether those whom we
chose as friends are encouraging us to be loyal to
God. You cannot avoid all contact with people who
are not serving God—those at work, at school, or in
your neighborhood. (1 Cor. 5:9, 10) You realize, however, that if you choose such ones as friends, you
might well compromise your friendship with God.
KEEPING COMPANY WITH SKEPTICS?

Zedekiah was not the only one who tried to ex-

ercise a negative in?uence on Jeremiah. A priest
named Pashhur “struck” Jeremiah, perhaps having
him beaten with 39 strokes. (Jer. 20:2; Deut. 25:3)
Some Judean princes did a similar thing and then
imprisoned Jeremiah in “the house of fetters.” The
prophet was put in a dungeon under conditions so
bad that after many days he feared he would die
there. (Read Jeremiah 37:3, 15, 16.) Then, after Jeremiah had been set free for a while, other princes urged

being ?ung into a miry cistern to die. (Jer. 38:1-4)
You have read that Jeremiah was saved from that
horrible death. Yet, these events illustrate how those
who should have known better became skeptical of
what God’s prophet had to say; they turned on him.
6

Jeremiah’s enemies were not limited to the civil

authorities. On another occasion, some men from
Jeremiah’s home city of Anathoth—his neighbors,
you might say—threatened to kill him if he did not
stop prophesying. (Jer. 11:21) They did not like what
they heard from him and they threatened him. Jeremiah, though, chose as his friend Jehovah rather
than neighbors. Other contemporaries went beyond
words. When Jeremiah graphically used a yoke to
urge the Jews to bring their necks under the yoke of
the king of Babylon and thus keep living, Hananiah removed the wooden yoke from Jeremiah’s neck
and broke it. According to that false prophet, Jehovah had said: “I will break the yoke of the king of

Babylon.” Hananiah died in that very year, and you
know which prophet proved reliable. (Jer. 28:1-11,
17) After Jerusalem was destroyed as Jeremiah had
forewarned, Johanan and other military chiefs refused to heed God’s command to stay in the land of
Judah. “It is a falsehood that you are speaking,” they
told Jeremiah. “Our God has not sent you, saying,
‘Do not enter into Egypt to reside there.’ ” They further de?ed Jehovah by taking Jeremiah and Baruch
with them into Egypt.—Jer. 42:1–43:7.

For years, Jeremiah was surrounded by skeptics

and opponents. Re?ect on his course. He could easily have resigned himself to accepting people who
had little respect for God or His Word. They were
all around him. What of your situation? You have

they aggressively oppose you and your God or seem

to be fairly pleasant people, will you choose them as
friends? Would it be wise to socialize with people
who do not take God’s prophecies seriously? If Jeremiah were in your place, would he choose as friends
people whose way of life denies the truth of God’s
Word or who put their trust in men? (2 Chron. 19:2)
God did not leave Jeremiah in doubt about the results of trusting in men rather than in God. (Read
Jeremiah 17:5, 6.) How do you feel about that?
8

Some Christians have felt that they could pro-

mote their business or career by choosing to entertain worldly clients. Would pursuing such a course,
though, expose such Christians to corrupt associations and dangers, such as ?lthy talk or heavy drinking? You can understand why many Christians who
face such a decision have chosen to avoid bad associations even if it means forgoing potential pro?ts or
advancement in a worldly sense. Similarly, an employer or fellow employees might not hesitate to
deal with customers dishonestly. Nevertheless, true

Christians are not swayed by those around them. At
times, making decisions about such matters may not
be easy. We can be thankful for such examples as
Jeremiah, who held to a course that left him with a
good conscience and, more important, a good relationship with God.
9

Jeremiah’s position and convictions made him an

object of derision by some fellow Judeans. (Jer. 18:
18) Still, he was willing to stand out as di?erent
from his contemporaries who followed “the popular
course.” (Jer. 8:5, 6) Jeremiah was even willing to be
alone at times, ‘sitting down all by himself.’ He preferred that to bad company, to being friends with
those who would have a negative in?uence on him.
(Read Jeremiah 9:4, 5; 15:17.) What about you? Today, as in Jeremiah’s day, the popular course is
one of unfaithfulness to God. Jehovah’s servants
have long had to be cautious about their choice of
friends. This is not to say that Jeremiah was without
friends. Some individuals defended and supported

him. Who were these people? Your knowing can help
you greatly.
WHAT FRIENDS DID JEREMIAH CHO O SE?
10

With whom would Jeremiah cultivate friend-

ship? Under Jehovah’s direction, he repeatedly condemned those who were wicked, deceitful, unjust,
violent, uncaring, and immoral—those who abandoned pure worship in favor of idolatry, thus committing spiritual prostitution. He urged his fellow Judeans: “Turn back, please, each one from his bad
way, and make your ways and your dealings good.”
(Jer. 18:11) Even after Jerusalem’s destruction, Jeremiah extolled God’s “acts of loving-kindness,” his
“mercies,” and his “faithfulness.” (Lam. 3:22-24) Jeremiah wanted as friends only faithful servants of Jehovah.—Read Jeremiah 17:7.
11

We are not completely in the dark about those

whom Jeremiah chose as friends, or close associates.
A number of men were clearly allies—Ebed-melech,
Baruch, Seraiah, and the sons of Shaphan. We might

79

ask: ‘What were these men like? What association
did they have with Jeremiah? In what sense were
they his good friends? And how did they help Jeremiah to maintain his integrity?’ Let us see, with our
own situation in mind.
12

The prophet’s closest friend appears to have

been Baruch, the son of Neriah. Jeremiah con?dently entrusted him with the responsibilities of writing
down Jehovah’s pronouncements as the prophet dictated them and then reading the resulting scroll, ?rst
in public and then to Judah’s princes. (Jer. 36:4-8, 14,
15) Baruch shared Jeremiah’s faith and conviction
that what God foretold would occur. Those men had
similar experiences during Judah’s last 18 turbulent
years. They spent much time working together on
a common spiritual assignment. Both encountered
di?culties and needed to hide from enemies. And
both received personal encouragement from Jehovah. Baruch seems to have belonged to a prominent
scribal family in Judah. The Scriptures call him “the

secretary,” and his brother Seraiah was an important
state functionary. Like Baruch, Seraiah later worked
with Jeremiah to deliver Jehovah’s prophetic proclamations. (Jer. 36:32; 51:59-64) The willingness of
these two sons of Neriah to work along with Jeremiah in those di?cult times must have strengthened
and encouraged the prophet. You too can receive
strength and encouragement from those who faithfully work at your side in Jehovah’s service.
What can you learn from Jeremiah’s choice of friends?
13

Ebed-melech was another outstanding ally of Jer-

emiah. When enraged princes cast Jeremiah into an
empty cistern to die, the man who dared to defend
him was a foreigner, Ebed-melech the Ethiopian. He
was a eunuch, that is, an o?cer, in the king’s house.
He publicly approached Zedekiah, who was seated in
the Gate of Benjamin. Ebed-melech courageously
sought permission from Zedekiah to rescue Jeremiah
out of the miry cistern. He took 30 men with him to
do the job, which suggests that Ebed-melech might

81

have expected physical interference from Jeremiah’s
enemies. (Jer. 38:7-13) We do not know just how
much association Ebed-melech had with Jeremiah.
Based on their friendship with Jehovah, it is logical
to assume that the two were good friends. Ebedmelech knew that Jeremiah was Jehovah’s prophet.
He called the princes’ actions “bad” and was willing
to risk compromising his own position in order to
do what was right. Yes, Ebed-melech was a good
man. So much so that Jehovah himself assured him:
“I will deliver you in [the day of Jerusalem’s calamity] . . . because you have trusted in me.” (Read Jeremiah 39:15-18.) What a recommendation! Is that not the
kind of friend you want?
14

Among Jeremiah’s other friends were three sons

and a grandson of Shaphan. They belonged to a
family of high-ranking men, Shaphan having earlier
served as the secretary of King Josiah. When Jeremiah’s enemies ?rst wanted to kill the prophet, “it was
the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan that proved

82

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

to be with Jeremiah, in order not to give him into
the hand of the people.” (Jer. 26:24) Ahikam had a
brother named Gemariah. When Baruch read God’s
judgments in public, Gemariah’s son Micaiah heard
him and alerted his father and other princes. Concerned about Jehoiakim’s reaction, they advised Jeremiah and Baruch to hide. And when the king rejected the divine message, Gemariah was among those
who pleaded with the king not to burn the scroll.
(Jer. 36:9-25) Jeremiah entrusted yet another of Shaphan’s sons, Elasah, with a prophetic letter to the
Jews exiled in Babylon. (Jer. 29:1-3) So there you
have three sons and one grandson of Shaphan, all of
whom supported God’s prophet. Think of how Jeremiah must have appreciated such men! They were
friends but not because of similar tastes in food or
drink or because they liked similar entertainment or
hobbies. The friendship was based on much more.
CHO O SE YOUR FRIENDS WISELY
15

You can learn from Jeremiah’s dealings with his

contemporaries, bad ones and good ones. The king,
many princes, false prophets, and military chiefs
pressured him to change his message. Jeremiah,
though, was uncompromising. His stance did little to
endear him to those men, yet their friendship was
not what Jeremiah was seeking. All along, his best
friend was Jehovah. If hostility from certain quarters
was the price to pay for faithfulness to his God, then
Jeremiah was willing to pay it. (Read Lamentations 3:
52-59.) Nonetheless, as we have seen, Jeremiah was
not alone in his determination to serve Jehovah.
16

What made Ebed-melech a good friend was his

faith and trust in Jehovah. This man had the courage to act decisively, saving Jeremiah’s life. Baruch
willingly spent much time with Jeremiah and helped
him deliver Jehovah’s messages. Good friends in the
Christian congregation today can be just as precious
as these men were. Cameron, a 20-year-old regular
pioneer, appreciates the good impact that Kara, also

a pioneer, had upon her. Cameron says, “Kara encouraged me to keep Jehovah ?rst in my life, both
by her example and by her words.” The two sisters
lived some distance apart, yet Kara would call or
write Cameron on a regular basis to make sure that
her friend was doing well and to have an interchange
of encouragement. “She knew all about our family
circumstances,” recalls Cameron. “She knew what
was going on with my sister and how hard it was for
me when my sister rebelled and left the truth. She
was there for me through all of this, and I can’t
think of what I would have done without her positive in?uence and help. She has been an amazing
support for me.”
17

You can ?nd good friends in the Christian con-

gregation, whether they are about your same age or
not. Your brothers and sisters share your faith, your
values, your love for Jehovah, your hopes, and likely some of your trials. You can work side by side
with them in the Christian ministry. They will be
able to encourage you when you are undergoing
di?culties, and you, them. They will rejoice with

85

you when you have good times in Jehovah’s service.
Moreover, such friendships can last into the endless
future.—Prov. 17:17; 18:24; 27:9.
18

The lesson for us from Jeremiah’s choice of

friends should be obvious. Bear in mind this undeniable truth: You cannot really seek companionship
with people whose beliefs are in con?ict with Bible
teachings and still remain true to your convictions.
Acting in harmony with that fact is as important today as it was in Jeremiah’s time. To carry out his
commission faithfully and with Jehovah’s blessing,
Jeremiah was willing to be di?erent from the majority of his contemporaries. Is that not true in your
case too? Jeremiah chose companions who shared
his faith and who supported him in carrying out
his commission. Yes, every faithful Christian today
can learn from Jeremiah about choosing companions
wisely!—Prov. 13:20; 22:17.

CHAPTER SIX

“O BEY, P LEASE,
THE VOICE OF J EHOVAH ”
OBEDIENCE is not in style in today’s world. Many
do not make decisions according to even a general
guideline, such as ‘Do what is right.’ Rather, their
thinking might be summarized as ‘Do what you want’
or ‘Do what you can get away with.’ You can see this
when drivers disobey tra?c signals, investors violate
?nance statutes, and high o?cials break laws that
they may have helped establish. Such charging ahead
in “the popular course,” even though it is wrong and
harmful, was common in Jeremiah’s day too.—Jer.
8:6.
2

You realize that those desiring the favor of Al-

mighty God must not just follow “the popular
course.” Signi?cantly, Jeremiah presented a contrast
between those who had “not obeyed the voice of Jehovah” and those who wanted to obey Him. (Jer. 3:
1, 2. Those who follow “the popular course” often have what attitude, and
why should you be di?erent?
“Obey, Please, the Voice of Jehovah”

87

25; 7:28; 26:13; 38:20; 43:4, 7) We individually should
analyze where we stand in this regard. Why? Satan’s attacks on the integrity of true worshippers
have become particularly virulent. He is like a snake
that silently lies in wait for its prey and suddenly
strikes with a potentially fatal bite. Our determination to obey the voice of Jehovah helps to move us
away from the fangs of that snake. But how can we
strengthen our resolve to obey Jehovah? The writings
of Jeremiah can help us.
THE ONE TO WHOM WE OWE OBEDIENCE
3

Why does Jehovah deserve our strict obedience?

Jeremiah reveals one reason by calling Him “the Maker of the earth by his power, the One ?rmly establishing the productive land by his wisdom.” (Jer. 10:12)
Jehovah is the Sovereign of the universe. We should
fear him above all other rulers. He has the absolute
right to call on us to comply with his wise commands,
which are really in our permanent best interests.
—Jer. 10:6, 7.
3. Why does Jehovah deserve our obedience?
88

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

4

Jehovah, however, in addition to being the Univer-

sal Ruler, is the Sustainer of life—our life. This was
dramatically made plain to the Jews of Jeremiah’s
time. The land of Egypt depended a great deal on the
waters of a river, the Nile, but the situation was different in the Promised Land. To a large extent, God’s
people depended on seasonal rains, often storing runo? water in underground cisterns. (Deut. 11:13-17)
Only Jehovah could send rain to moisten the soil so
that it would produce. On the other hand, he could
also withhold the needed rain. Hence, in Jeremiah’s
day disobedient Jews experienced a series of devastating droughts that left their ?elds and vineyards
parched, their wells and cisterns dry.—Jer. 3:3; 5:24;
12:4; 14:1-4, 22; 23:10.
5

While those Jews valued literal water, they re-

jected the “living water” that Jehovah freely o?ered
them. They did this by deliberately disobeying God’s
Law and relying on alliances with surrounding nations. Like those who when water is scarce pour it

into a cistern that is cracked and cannot hold water,
the Jews su?ered the consequences. (Read Jeremiah
2:13; 17:13.) We certainly have reason not to bring
great calamity upon ourselves by pursuing a similar course. Jehovah continues to provide us with an
abundance of guidance based on his inspired Word.
Obviously, that “living water” bene?ts us only if we
regularly study it and strive to live by it.
6

As God’s day of reckoning with Judah drew near,

obedience became increasingly important. If individual Jews were to receive Jehovah’s favor and protection, they had to repent and start obeying him.
King Zedekiah faced this issue. He was not ?rm
for doing what was right. When his subordinates
told him they wanted to kill Jeremiah, he did not
have the backbone to resist them. As we noted in
the preceding chapter, the prophet survived that attempt on his life with the help of Ebed-melech and
later urged Zedekiah: “Obey, please, the voice of
Jehovah.” (Read Jeremiah 38:4-6, 20.) Clearly, for his

he obey God?
Why was it ?tting for Jeremiah to urge the Jews
repeatedly to obey God?
OBEYING JEHOVAH IS AN URGENT MATTER
7

Obedience is as important today as it was in Jere-

miah’s day. How strong is your resolve to obey Jehovah? If you were inadvertently exposed to a pornographic Internet Web site, would you keep looking at
it, or would you ?ght any temptation and escape from
that site? What if an unbeliever at work or at school
asked you for a date? Would you have the strength to
refuse? Would apostate literature or Internet sites intrigue you or repulse you? In these or other situations, bear in mind the words of Jeremiah 38:20.
8

Jehovah often sent Jeremiah to His people with

exhortations, such as: “Turn back, please, each one
from his bad way, and make your ways and your dealings good.” (Jer. 7:3; 18:11; 25:5; read Jeremiah 35:15.)
7. What are some situations in which your obedience might be tested?
8, 9. (a) Why is it wise to listen when the elders try to help you? (b) How
should you view repeated counsel from the elders?
“Obey, Please, the Voice of Jehovah”

91

Comparably, Christian elders today do their best to
help fellow believers in spiritual danger. If at some
time the elders o?er you counsel about avoiding an
unwise or wrong course, listen to them. Their goal is
like that of Jeremiah.
9

The elders may remind you of Scriptural princi-

ples that they have already shown you. Realize that
repeating counsel is never easy, but doing so becomes
far more di?cult if the one needing help displays an
attitude like that of many of the Jews who heard Jeremiah. Try to view the elders’ repeated e?orts to help
you as expressions of Jehovah’s love. Recognize, too,
that Jeremiah would not have needed to repeat his
warnings if there had been an appropriate response.
Yes, the way to avoid repeated counsel is to apply the
counsel promptly.
JEHOVAH’S FORGIVENES S
—FREELY GIVEN BUT NOT AUTOMATIC
10

We cannot obey Jehovah perfectly in this system

of things, however hard we try. So we thank him that
he shows a willingness to forgive our failings. Still,
10. Why does Jehovah not forgive sins automatically?
92

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

he does not pardon sins automatically. Why not? Because sin is repugnant to Jehovah. (Isa. 59:2) Therefore, he wants to be sure that we are worthy of his
forgiveness.
11

As we have noted, many Jews in Jeremiah’s time

habitually disobeyed God and thus abused his patience and mercy. Could one of God’s servants today
develop a similar tendency? Yes, if he or she ignores
Jehovah’s reminders and begins practicing sin. In
some cases, this has happened openly, as when someone enters into an adulterous marriage. But even if a
sin is unseen by other humans, the one disobeying Jehovah is on a dangerous course. A person leading a
double life might think, ‘No one will ?nd out.’ Yet,
the reality is that God looks inside minds and hearts
and can see what happens behind closed doors. (Read
Jeremiah 32:19.) What should be done if, in fact, one
has truly disobeyed God?
12

Many Jews scorned the help Jehovah o?ered time

serious sin today may be unrepentant, rejecting the
help of the elders. In that case, the elders must follow the Scriptural direction to protect the congregation by disfellowshipping the wrongdoer. (1 Cor. 5:1113; see the box “Living Without Law,” on page 95.)
But does that mean that he or she would be forever
beyond hope, never able to return to Jehovah’s favor?
No. The Israelites were long rebellious; still God said:
“Return, you renegade sons. I shall heal your renegade condition.” (Jer. 3:22)1 Jehovah invites wrongdoers to return to him. Indeed, he directs them to do so.
Why is it the sensible course to seek God’s forgiveness when
we err?
OBEY JEHOVAH BY RETURNING TO HIM
13

To return to God, as Jeremiah indicated, a per-

son needs to ask himself, ‘What have I done?’ Then,
in the light of Scriptural standards, he should accept the honest answer. The unrepentant Jews of
1 Jehovah was here addressing the northern kingdom of Israel. Those
of that ten-tribe kingdom had been in exile for some 100 years when Jeremiah delivered this message. He acknowledged that down to his day,
that nation had not repented. (2 Ki. 17:16-18, 24, 34, 35) Nevertheless,
individuals could return to God’s favor and even return from exile.

13. If someone wants to return to Jehovah, what must he recognize?
94

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

LIVING WITHOUT LAW
What was life like among the Jews after Jerusalem’s destruction? Jeremiah provides us with a partial description at Lamentations 2:9. The walls of the
city were broken down, perhaps including the gates
that formerly protected the city. But worse than
that, there was “no law.” Did Jeremiah mean that the
survivors had become an uncontrollable mob? More
likely he was referring to the loss of the spiritual security and comfort that the Jews had once enjoyed
when faithful priests and prophets instructed them
in God’s Law. The false prophets who now had their
attention were o?ering no real ‘vision,’ or direction,
from Jehovah; what they “visioned” was worthless.
—Lam. 2:14.
One who has been disfellowshipped from the
Christian congregation may sense himself in a similar situation. The warm friendship he once enjoyed
with his spiritual brothers and sisters is gone, as is
the loving attention from the elders. And he is away
from the vital spiritual instruction he had enjoyed.
In the world, where there is “no law” from Jehovah,
he probably feels a great sense of loss. Nevertheless,
he can return to an approved condition before Jehovah and enjoy rich blessings again. (2 Cor. 2:6-10)
You certainly must agree, though, that obeying Jehovah and never coming to be without law is much
to be preferred.
“Obey, Please, the Voice of Jehovah”

95

WHAT IS REPENTANCE?
The Hebrew and Greek words related to repentance in the Bible have to do with a person’s attitude; he changes his mind regarding a wrong
course of action that he followed or was about to
follow. Those words also describe the feelings such
a person has, including regret and comfort. (2 Sam.
13:39; Job 42:6) The Bible makes clear that true
repentance involves actions motivated by strong,
heartfelt emotions. This kind of repentance is
what Jehovah looks for in all who claim to repent
of their sins.—Jer. 31:18, 19.
Jeremiah’s time dodged that question. They refused
to acknowledge the extent of their sins, so Jehovah
did not—could not—forgive them. (Read Jeremiah
8:6.) In contrast, a repentant sinner recognizes that
in disobeying Jehovah, he has brought reproach on
God’s name and on the Christian congregation. A
person who is truly repentant is also deeply saddened
by the harm he may have caused innocent people. He
should recognize that only when he acknowledges the
full e?ects of his bad actions will his request for for96

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

giveness have weight with Jehovah. Still, returning to
God’s favor involves more.
14

A truly repentant person searches out his mo-

tives, desires, and habits. (Read Lamentations 3:40, 41.)
He will examine areas of his life where he displays
weakness, such as in his friendships with the opposite sex, his use of alcohol or tobacco, his use of the
Internet, or his business dealings. As a housewife
scrubs even the hidden corners of her kitchen to keep
her home clean and sanitary, a repentant person
should work hard to clean up his thoughts and private actions. He must “return clear to Jehovah” by
ful?lling God’s requirements and conforming to His
standards. Some Jews in Jeremiah’s time returned
to Jehovah “falsely.” They pretended to be remorseful but never changed their hearts or lives. (Jer. 3:
10) Unlike them, one whose request for forgiveness
is genuine does not try to fool Jehovah and His
congregation. Rather than merely wanting to save
face or to regain association with relatives or others
14. How does a person “return clear to Jehovah”? (Include the box “What
Is Repentance?” on page 96.)
“Obey, Please, the Voice of Jehovah”

97

in the truth, he wants to turn his back completely on
the wrongs he has committed and merit God’s forgiveness and favor.
15

Prayer is a vital part of repentance. In ancient

times, it was not uncommon for people to lift their
hands toward heaven when praying. Today, when a
truly repentant person prays, he ‘raises his heart
along with his palms to God,’ as Jeremiah expressed
it. (Lam. 3:41, 42) Feeling regret motivates the repentant sinner to bring his conduct in line with his plea
for forgiveness. His prayers are sincere, springing
from his very heart.
16

You undoubtedly realize that a sinner who truly

acknowledges his errors may have to overcome his
pride. But this is a key fact: Jehovah wants sinners to
come back to him. When God sees genuine contrition
in a human heart, his own heart responds. He becomes “boisterous” with tender emotions because he
wants to forgive all who repent of their sins, even as
he did for the Israelites who returned from exile. (Jer.

peace and hope for those who obey him! (Jer. 29:1114) They can once again have a place among God’s
devoted servants.
OBEDIENCE CAN PROTECT YOU
17

Strictly obeying Jehovah is the safe course. We

can see that by the example of the Rechabites in Jeremiah’s day. Over two centuries earlier, their Kenite
forefather Jehonadab, who loyally took sides with
Jehu, had given them a number of restrictive commands. One was against drinking wine. Jehonadab
was long dead, but the Rechabites kept obeying him.
As a test, Jeremiah took them to a dining room in the
temple and placed wine before them, urging them to
drink. They told him: “We shall drink no wine.”—Jer.
35:1-10.
18

To the Rechabites, obeying their long-dead ances-

tor was important. With even greater diligence, true
worshippers should obey the commands of the living God. The Rechabites’ resolve to obey impressed

Jehovah, and it stood in stark contrast to the Jews’
disobedience. God promised the Rechabites protection from the coming calamity. Applying that lesson
today, is it not reasonable that those who strictly
obey Jehovah are assured of his protection during the
great tribulation?—Read Jeremiah 35:19.
Why is repenting over serious sin an important aspect of
obedience? How can obedience help one to avoid needing
to repent?
THO SE WHO OBEY JEHOVAH ARE NOT ALONE
19

God’s protective care of his people should not be

viewed as limited to the past. Even now, Jehovah protects obedient ones from spiritual danger. As a high
wall protected ancient cities from attack, God’s law
protects those who study it and constantly apply it.
Will you stay inside the protective wall of God’s moral regulations? You can be sure that it will go well
with you if you do. (Jer. 7:23) Many experiences testify to that fact.—See the box “Obeying Jehovah Brings
Protection,” on page 101.

A young Witness in Spain has greatly bene?ted from obeying Jehovah. He writes: “In school,
a girl in my class wanted me to date her. She was
very pretty, yet I knew in my heart that dating
someone who does not love Jehovah is dangerous.
“About the same time, my classmates were
pressuring me to attend an end-of-term party.
When I gave them Biblical reasons why I would
not, they called me names. I felt like an outcast. I mentioned the matter to an elder in my
congregation. He asked me, ‘Can those who do
not respect your decisions and moral values become your true friends?’ Those words gave me
strength and helped me to resist the pressure
from my classmates.
“I am so glad I did. At that party, one girl was
raped. That same night, three of my classmates
were severely injured in a car accident because
the person driving had been drinking. Had I
gone to that party, I might have been in the car
with them. I thank Jehovah for strengthening
me to obey him in the face of peer pressure at
school.”

Whether they are in your family, at your work-

place or school, or among authorities where you live,
opposers make serving God a challenge. You can be
sure, though, that if in all cases you strictly obey Jehovah, he will support you through even the most dif?cult situations. Do not forget—God promised to
sustain Jeremiah amid the ?erce opposition he would
encounter, and Jehovah did just that. (Read Jeremiah
1:17-19.) One of the times when God’s support became evident was in the days of King Jehoiakim.
21

Few rulers of Israel opposed God’s spokesmen

with fury like that of Jehoiakim. We can see this in
the case of the prophet Urijah, Jeremiah’s contemporary. Wicked King Jehoiakim was willing to have
him pursued across international borders. When Jehovah’s prophet Urijah was brought back, the king
had him slain. (Jer. 26:20-23) In the fourth year of
Jehoiakim’s reign, Jehovah commanded Jeremiah to
write down all the words He had spoken up to that
time and then to read them aloud at the temple. Je20, 21. (a) Of what can you be sure as you serve Jehovah? (b) How did

hoiakim obtained Jeremiah’s scroll and had a court
o?cial read it to him. As the reading proceeded, the
king tore up the document and threw it into a ?re
piece by piece, though some of the princes urged him
not to. He then sent men to arrest Jeremiah and
Baruch. What happened? “Jehovah kept them concealed.” (Jer. 36:1-6; read Jeremiah 36:21-26.) Jehovah
did not allow Jehoiakim to harm those two faithful
men.
22

If Jehovah sees ?t, he can also hide his modern-

day servants from danger. But more often, he gives
them the courage and wisdom to obey him and to
continue preaching the good news. A single mother whom we shall call Gulistan has four children.
She has received Jehovah’s support. For a time,
she was the only Witness in a wide area of central Asia where the authorities oppose the Kingdom
preaching. The nearest congregation is over 250 miles
away, hence Gulistan rarely has the companionship
of mature Christians. Despite opposition and other

problems, she preaches from house to house and ?nds
many interested ones. According to a recent report,
she was conducting Bible studies with up to 20 people
and giving attention to a growing group of Jehovah’s
sheep.
23

Just as he helped Jeremiah and such Witnesses as

Gulistan, God is ready to help you and his other obedient servants. Be resolved to obey him as Ruler rather than men. Then, opposition and other obstacles
will not keep you from publicly praising the only true
God before those in your territory.—Jer. 15:20, 21.
24

Real joy and satisfaction in life are unattainable

if we live independently of our Creator. (Jer. 10:23)
After studying what Jeremiah wrote about obedience,
do you see ways in which you can let Jehovah direct
your steps more fully? His commands make up the
only guide for living that leads to complete happiness
and success. “Obey my voice,” urges Jehovah, “in order that it may go well with you.”—Jer. 7:23.

“I W ILL S ATURATE
THE T IRED S OUL ”
“THE new world.” On hearing those words, do you
think of some of the foretold visible blessings? Perhaps a perfect body, ample healthful food, peaceful
animals, or secure housing. You can likely cite Bible
verses on which you base those expectations. Do not
overlook, however, this blessing—good spiritual and
emotional health. Without that, all other joys would
soon fade.
2

When having Jeremiah foretell the return of the

Jews from Babylon, God gave attention to how they
would feel: “You will yet deck yourself with your tambourines and actually go forth in the dance of those
who are laughing.” (Read Jeremiah 30:18, 19; 31:4, 1214.) God added something that may touch you: “I will
saturate the tired soul, and every languishing soul I
will ?ll.” The NET Bible renders God’s promise: “I will

105

fully satisfy the needs of those who are weary and fully refresh the souls of those who are faint.”—Jer.
31:25.
3

What a prospect! Jehovah said that he would sat-

urate, or fully satisfy, the one tired and discouraged.
Yes, and what God promises, he does. Jeremiah’s
writings give us con?dence that we too will be satis?ed. More than that, those writings provide us with
insight on how, even now, we can be encouraged and
optimistic. Moreover, they illustrate practical ways
that we may encourage others, helping them to satisfy their tired souls.
4

That promise was a basis for comfort to Jeremi-

ah, and it can be the same to us. Why? Recall a point
mentioned in Chapter 1 of this volume—that Jeremiah was “a man with feelings like ours,” even as Elijah was. (Jas. 5:17) Think of just a few reasons why,
at times, Jeremiah might have felt discouraged or
even a bit depressed. As you do so, imagine how you
would feel in similar situations and why circumstances that you face may discourage you.—Rom. 15:4.
4. Why can we identify with Jeremiah’s feelings?
106

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

5

Jeremiah’s discouragement may, in part, have

come from his hometown. He grew up in Anathoth.
That was a Levite city a few miles northeast of Jerusalem. The prophet would have had acquaintances
and perhaps relatives in Anathoth. Jesus said that a
prophet has no honor in his homeland, and this was
true of Jeremiah. (John 4:44) The townspeople went
beyond being disinterested in or disrespectful of Jeremiah. At one point, God said that “the men of Anathoth” were “seeking for [Jeremiah’s] soul.” They
belligerently said: “You must not prophesy in the
name of Jehovah, that you may not die at our hand.”
What a threat from neighbors and possibly relatives,
who should have been on his side!—Jer. 1:1; 11:21.
6

If you feel pressure from neighbors, schoolmates,

workmates, or even some family members, take comfort from how Jehovah dealt with Jeremiah. Back
then, God said he would ‘turn his attention upon’
those in Anathoth who were opposing his prophet.
(Read Jeremiah 11:22, 23.) God’s assurance certainly

helped Jeremiah overcome any discouragement resulting from that local opposition. Later, God’s attention would—and did—result in “calamity upon
the men of Anathoth.” In your case, be reassured
that Jehovah is observing matters, or giving them
attention. (Ps. 11:4; 66:7) Your ‘staying by’ Bible
teachings and doing what is right may yet help some
opposers avoid the calamity that would otherwise befall them.—1 Tim. 4:16.
In the book of Jeremiah, what indicates that God is
interested in his people’s feelings, and how might this have
helped the prophet?
ACTS THAT COULD DIS COURAGE
7

Jeremiah faced far more than verbal threats from

people back home. One instance centered on a notable man in Jerusalem, a priest named Pashhur.1
Upon hearing a divine prophecy, “Pashhur struck
Jeremiah the prophet and put him into the stocks.”
(Jer. 20:1, 2) Those words probably meant far more
1 During Zedekiah’s reign, there was a di?erent Pashhur, a prince who
petitioned the king to have Jeremiah killed.—Jer. 38:1-5.

7, 8. What type of abuse did Jeremiah su?er, and how did it a?ect him?
108

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

than a slap on the face. Some conclude that Pashhur
had Jeremiah beaten or ?ogged with up to 40 stripes.
(Deut. 25:3) While Jeremiah was su?ering physically,
people may have been jeering him and screaming
abuse, even spitting on him. It did not end there.
Pashhur had Jeremiah put in “stocks” overnight. The
Hebrew word used suggests that the body was twisted and bent. Yes, Jeremiah was cruelly forced to suffer a painful night, probably fastened in a wooden
frame.
8

How did such treatment a?ect Jeremiah? He said

to God: “I became an object of laughter all day long.”
(Jer. 20:3-7) It even crossed his mind to cease speaking out in God’s name. You know, however, that Jeremiah could not and did not do that. Rather, the divine message he was commissioned to deliver was
“like a burning ?re shut up in [Jeremiah’s] bones,”
and he had to speak for Jehovah.—Read Jeremiah 20:
8, 9.
9

That account can help us if we face malicious

ridicule from those we know, be they relatives,

109

neighbors, workmates, or schoolmates. We need not
be shocked if, at times, such opposition makes us feel
a bit discouraged. That may also occur if we undergo physical mistreatment because we pursue true
worship. The imperfect man Jeremiah was a?ected
by such things, and do we not have human feelings
like he did? Yet, we must not forget that with God’s
help, Jeremiah recovered his joy and con?dence. The
discouragement was not permanent, and it need not
be so in our case.—2 Cor. 4:16-18.
10

Sometimes Jeremiah’s mood changed, even con-

siderably. Have you too had to deal with a similar
thing—perhaps feeling optimistic and positive but
then feeling downcast and gloomy? Regarding the
former feeling, note the words at Jeremiah 20:12, 13.
(Read.) After what Pashhur put him through, Jeremiah rejoiced over being like one of the poor ones delivered “out of the hand of evildoers.” At times, you
have probably felt like exulting, desirous of singing
to Jehovah, whether that was after you were some10. What insight does the Bible provide about Jeremiah’s mood?
110

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

how delivered or in response to a happy development
in your life or Christian service. How ?ne it is to feel
like that!—Acts 16:25, 26.
11

Yet, because we are imperfect, our mood may

change, as Jeremiah’s did. After exclaiming “sing to
Jehovah,” he felt deep despair, perhaps with tears
?owing. (Read Jeremiah 20:14-16.) His spirits were so
low that he wondered what value there was in his
having been born! In his gloomy state, he said that
the man who had announced his birth was as lamentable as Sodom and Gomorrah. But here is a
key issue: Did Jeremiah continue to despair? Did
he give up, resigning himself to ongoing feelings of
discouragement? No. Instead, he must have worked
to overcome his discouragement, and he succeeded.
Consider what is related next, according to the arrangement of the book of Jeremiah. The other Pashhur, the prince, approached Jeremiah with an inquiry from King Zedekiah about the Babylonians
besieging Jerusalem. Jeremiah rose to the occasion,

111

boldly declaring Jehovah’s judgment and what the
outcome would be. (Jer. 21:1-7) Clearly, Jeremiah was
continuing active as a prophet!
12

Some of God’s servants today experience mood

changes. These may have a physical cause—perhaps
hormonal surges or a biochemical imbalance—and a
quali?ed physician may suggest ways to limit the extent of such mood swings. (Luke 5:31) For most of us,
though, the exhilaration or gloominess that we sometimes feel is neither extreme nor abnormal. Likely,
most negative feelings are a part of imperfect human
life. They may result from tiredness or the loss of a
loved one. If we face such situations, we can recall
that Jeremiah dealt with mood changes, yet he remained in God’s favor. To cope, we may need to adjust our routine to get more rest. Or we may need to
give ourselves time to gain comfort after our grievous loss. However, it is vitally important that we
maintain our attendance at Christian meetings and
our regular share in theocratic activities. Those are
12, 13. What might we do to cope with notable changes in our mood?
112

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

keys to staying balanced and having joy in serving
God.—Matt. 5:3; Rom. 12:10-12.
13

Whether your downheartedness is a singular,

rare event or is part of a pattern of mood changes,
Jeremiah’s experience can speak to you. As mentioned, at times he felt quite down. Nevertheless, he
did not let discouragement turn him away from the
God whom he loved and served faithfully. When his
opponents responded to his good by doing bad, he
turned to Jehovah and trusted in him. (Jer. 18:19,
20, 23) Be determined to imitate Jeremiah.—Lam. 3:
55-57.
If at times you feel discouraged or gloomy, how can you
apply what you ?nd in the book of Jeremiah?
WILL YOU REFRESH TIRED S OULS?
14

We do well to give attention to how Jeremiah

was encouraged and how he encouraged others who
were ‘tired souls.’ (Jer. 31:25) The prophet received
encouragement particularly from Jehovah. Think of
how built up you would have been to hear Jehovah
14. How in particular did Jeremiah receive encouragement?
“I Will Saturate the Tired Soul”

113

tell you: “As for me, here I have made you today a
forti?ed city . . . They will be certain to ?ght against
you, but they will not prevail against you, for ‘I am
with you,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘to deliver
you.’ ” (Jer. 1:18, 19) With good reason, Jeremiah referred to Jehovah as “my strength and my stronghold,
and my place for ?ight in the day of distress.”—Jer.
16:19.
15

It is noteworthy that Jehovah told Jeremiah: “I

am with you.” Do you see in that a clue as to what
you can do when someone you know needs encouragement? It is one thing to realize that a Christian
brother or sister or perhaps a relative has that need;
it is another thing to respond e?ectively to that need.
In many cases, the most e?ective course is to do what
God did for Jeremiah—just be with the a?icted one.
Then, at some point, o?er words of encouragement,
but not a torrent of words. Fewer words will likely do
more good if they are words chosen to reassure and
build up. What you say need not be eloquent. Use
15, 16. The way that Jehovah encouraged Jeremiah o?ers what clue as to
what we can do to encourage others?
114

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

simple words that manifest interest, concern, and
Christian a?ection. Words like that can do much
good.—Read Proverbs 25:11.
16

Jeremiah asked: “O Jehovah, remember me and

turn your attention to me.” Then what? The prophet
relates: “Your words were found, and I proceeded to
eat them; and your word becomes to me the exultation and the rejoicing of my heart.” (Jer. 15:15, 16)
The one whom you want to encourage may similarly
need kind attention. Granted, your words are not on
the same level as those of Jehovah. You can, though,
include some of God’s words in what you say. Such
sincere, heartfelt, Bible-based expressions can truly
make the heart of the discouraged one rejoice.—Read
Jeremiah 17:7, 8.
17

Take note that beyond receiving encouragement

from God, Jeremiah encouraged others. How? At one
point, King Zedekiah told Jeremiah about his fear of
the Jews who allied themselves with the Babylonians.
The prophet spoke encouraging words, urging the

king to obey Jehovah and experience a positive outcome. (Jer. 38:19, 20) After Jerusalem fell and a mere
remnant of Jews remained in the land, their military
chief Johanan considered taking the people to Egypt.
But ?rst, he inquired of Jeremiah. The prophet listened to Johanan’s expression and then prayed to
Jehovah. Later, he conveyed Jehovah’s encouraging
answer, mentioning that good would come from following the divine direction to remain in the land.
(Jer. 42:1-12) In both cases, Jeremiah lent a hearing
ear—he listened before he spoke. Listening is fundamental to encouraging others. Let the a?icted one
open his heart. Listen to his concerns, his fears.
When it is appropriate, o?er encouraging words. You
will not have a divine revelation to o?er to the one
needing encouragement, yet you can include positive
thoughts from the Word of God, thoughts that focus
on what the future holds.—Jer. 31:7-14.
18

Neither Zedekiah nor Johanan accepted the en-

couraging advice Jeremiah delivered, and some today

may not seem to respond to yours. Do not let that
discourage you. Others did respond favorably to the
encouragement Jeremiah gave them, and likely many
will respond to yours. Think of the Rechabites, a
group of Kenites linked to the Jews for many years.
Among the commands coming down from their ancestor Jehonadab was that as alien residents, they not
drink wine. When the Babylonians were attacking,
Jeremiah brought the Rechabites to a dining room in
the temple. At God’s direction, Jeremiah set wine before them. Respectful of their ancestor and in contrast to Israel’s disobedience, the Rechabites were
obedient and would not drink the wine. (Jer. 35:3-10)
Jeremiah conveyed to them commendation from Jehovah and His promise for their future. (Read Jeremiah 35:14, 17-19.) That is a pattern you can follow in
o?ering encouragement: Honestly commend others
when possible.
19

Jeremiah also did that with Ebed-melech, an

Ethiopian who evidently served as an o?cial in
the court of King Zedekiah. Judean princes had

117

Jeremiah unjustly thrown into a miry cistern and
left him there to die. Ebed-melech appealed to
King Zedekiah, who authorized him to save the
prophet. This foreign man did so, in the face of possibly violent interference. (Jer. 38:7-13) Having likely alienated those Judean princes, Ebed-melech may
have been apprehensive about his future. Jeremiah
did not remain silent, just hoping that Ebed-melech
would get over it. He spoke up, passing along encouraging words about God’s future blessings for Ebedmelech.—Jer. 39:15-18.
20

Truly, as we read the book of Jeremiah, we

?nd excellent examples of how we personally can
do what the apostle Paul urged our brothers in
Thessalonica to do: “Keep comforting one another
and building one another up . . . The undeserved
kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.”
—1 Thess. 5:11, 28.

CHAPTER EIGHT

W ILL YOU “K EEP L IVING,”
AS D ID J EREMIAH?
AFTER Joshua urged the Israelites to choose whom
they would serve, he said: “As for me and my household, we shall serve Jehovah.” (Josh. 24:15) Joshua
was determined to be loyal to God, and he was
sure that his family too would be loyal. Much later, as Jerusalem’s destruction neared, Jeremiah told
King Zedekiah that if he surrendered to the Babylonians, “you yourself and your household will certainly
keep living.” (Jer. 38:17) The king’s bad choice a?ected him, his wives, and his sons. He watched his sons
be killed; then he was blinded and taken captive to
Babylon.—Jer. 38:18-23; 39:6, 7.
2

In each of those two italicized phrases, one per-

son was directly involved. But his family was also
mentioned. That is logical. Each adult is responsible
to God. Yet, most Israelites were part of a family.
1, 2. Why is it logical to give attention to both the individual and the family?
Will You “Keep Living,” as Did Jeremiah?

119

The family is important for Christians too. We see
that from what we read in the Bible and from what
we consider at Christian meetings regarding marriage, child rearing, and respect for family members.
—1 Cor. 7:36-39; 1 Tim. 5:8.
AN UNUSUAL COMMAND
3

Jeremiah was one who did “keep living” in his

day. He survived Jerusalem’s destruction, though his
personal situation was di?erent from most. (Jer.
21:9; 40:1-4) God had told him not to marry or have
o?spring or share in some other common aspects of
Jewish life at that time.—Read Jeremiah 16:1-4.
4

In Jeremiah’s day and culture, it was normal to

marry and to have children. Most Jewish men did,
thus keeping the ancestral land in the tribe and family.1 (Deut. 7:14) Why not Jeremiah? Because of
what lay ahead, God told him not to share in normal
occasions for sorrow or rejoicing. He was not to com1 In the Hebrew Scriptures, there is no word for “bachelor.”

3, 4. In what ways was Jeremiah’s situation di?erent from most, and how

120

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

fort mourners or to eat with them after a funeral; nor
was he to take part in the levity of Jewish weddings.
Such feasting and rejoicing would soon end for all.
(Jer. 7:33; 16:5-9) Jeremiah’s course gave credence to
his message and underscored how grave the coming
judgment would be. Eventually that calamity arrived. Can you imagine the feelings of those who
were reduced to cannibalism or those who saw loved
ones become mere carrion? (Read Jeremiah 14:16;
Lam. 2:20.) Thus, unmarried Jeremiah was not to be
pitied. Though the 18-month siege and its carnage
would wipe out families, Jeremiah would be spared
the loss of a mate or children.
5

Could it be said, though, that Jeremiah 16:5-9 ap-

plies to us? No. Christians are urged “to comfort
those in any sort of tribulation” and to “rejoice with
people who rejoice.” (2 Cor. 1:4; Rom. 12:15) Jesus
attended a wedding and contributed to the rejoicing.
Nevertheless, what lies ahead for this wicked system of things is serious. Christians may even face
5. What bearing do the directions found at Jeremiah 16:5-9 have on Christians?

121

hardships and deprivations. Jesus stressed the need
to be ready to do what it takes to endure and keep
faithful, as did our brothers who ?ed Judea in the
?rst century. Hence, staying single, getting married,
or having children merits serious thought.—Read
Matthew 24:17, 18.
6

What relevance is there in God’s command that

Jeremiah not marry or have children? Today, some
loyal Christians are unmarried or have no children.
What might they learn from Jeremiah’s case? And
why should even Christians who are married and
have children give attention to this feature of Jeremiah’s life?
7

Consider ?rst that Jeremiah was to remain child-

less. Jesus did not command his followers to abstain from having children. Yet, it is noteworthy that
he pronounced “woe” on pregnant women or those
nursing a baby when tribulation came on Jerusalem
in 66-70 C.E. That time would be especially di?cult
for them, given their situation. (Matt. 24:19) We now

face a greater tribulation. This should add a dimension for Christian couples who are deciding whether to have children. Do you not agree that it seems
harder and harder to deal with these critical times?
And couples have admitted that it has been very
challenging to raise children who will “keep living”
through the end of the present system. While each
couple must decide if they will have children, Jeremiah’s case is worth considering. But what of God’s
command that he not even get married?
Jeremiah received what unusual command, and what should
that move us to consider?
LEARN FROM JEREMIAH’S SINGLENES S
8

In telling Jeremiah not to marry, God did not es-

tablish a norm that all his servants were to follow.
Marriage is good. Jehovah initiated human marriage
to populate the earth and to be a source of abundant
satisfaction and delight. (Prov. 5:18) Still, not all
were married. There may have been some eunuchs
associated with God’s people while Jeremiah was

Will You “Keep Living,” as Did Jeremiah?

123

prophesying.1 In addition, you can be sure that there
were widows and widowers. So Jeremiah was not the
only true worshipper who did not have a mate. Of
course, he had a reason for not marrying, and so do
some Christians today.
9

Many Christians do get married, but not all. You

know that Jesus did not, and he said that some disciples would have the gift to “make room for” singleness in their mind and heart. He urged those who
could to do so. (Read Matthew 19:11, 12.) Therefore, it
would be proper to commend, not tease, one who
pursues singleness so as to do more in God’s service.
Granted, some Christians are single, at least for a
time, because of circumstances. For example, they
may not have found a suitable Christian mate and
commendably are determined to uphold God’s standard to marry “only in the Lord.” (1 Cor. 7:39) And,
1 Isaiah prophetically addressed literal eunuchs in his day, who would
have a limited share in Israelite worship. He foretold that by obedience
eunuchs would gain “something better than sons and daughters,” receiving “a name to time inde?nite” in God’s house.—Isa. 56:4, 5.

9. What inspired counsel regarding marriage should we seriously consider?
124

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

of course, some of God’s servants are widows or widowers, thus being single.1 They should never forget
that God (and Jesus) have long displayed concern for
such single ones.—Jer. 22:3; read 1 Corinthians 7:8, 9.
10

Accordingly, as Jeremiah maintained his single-

ness, he could draw on God for support. How? Well,
recall that Jeremiah took delight in Jehovah’s word.
That would have been a source of strength and reassurance to Jeremiah over the decades as he focused
on his God-ordained ministry. Furthermore, he carefully avoided the company of those who might ridicule him for being single. He was willing to ‘sit down
all by himself’ rather than to be around those with
such tendencies.—Read Jeremiah 15:17.
11

Many single Christians— men and women,

whether young or advanced in years—are following
Jeremiah’s good example. Experiences show what a
great help it is to be immersed in God’s service, to

have a large share in meaningful spiritual activities. For example, a Witness serving with a Chineselanguage congregation observes: “Pioneering gives
my life direction. As a single sister, I lead a busy, active life, which helps me to avoid loneliness. I feel
satis?ed at the end of each day because I can see that
my ministry really helps people. This gives me great
joy.” A pioneer aged 38 says: “I think the secret to
happiness is being able to enjoy the positive aspects
of whatever situation you ?nd yourself in.” An unmarried Christian in southern Europe noted frankly: “My life may not have turned out exactly as I
planned, but I am happy and will continue to be so.”
12

Could it be that Jeremiah noted that his life had

not turned out as he had planned while growing up?
But he might wisely have seen that such is also true
of many who marry and have children. A pioneer in
Spain shared this insight: “I know married people
who are happy and others who are unhappy. This reality convinces me that my happiness does not de12, 13. (a) What is a realistic view of both singleness and marriage?

most precious. I can commune with Jehovah
in prayer. I can enjoy meditation and personal
study without distraction. . . . Singleness has contributed not a little to my joy.”—Babette
pend on whether I get married in the future or not.”
Without question, Jeremiah’s experience—just one
of thousands—proves that a full, rewarding, happy
life is possible for one who is single. We have further
con?rmation from the apostle Paul, who wrote: “I
say to the unmarried persons and the widows, it is
well for them that they remain even as I am.” (1 Cor.
7:8) Paul may have been a widower. In any case, he
was unmarried when he did so much in the missionary service. (1 Cor. 9:5) Is it not reasonable to conclude that his single state was an advantage? For him
it meant “constant attendance upon the Lord without distraction,” and thus he accomplished much
good.—1 Cor. 7:35.
13

Paul was inspired to add something else: “Those

who [marry] will have tribulation in their ?esh.” God

had Paul include this profound truth: “If anyone
stands settled in his heart . . . to keep his own virginity, he will do well. Consequently he also that
gives his virginity in marriage does well, but he that
does not give it in marriage will do better.” (1 Cor.
7:28, 37, 38) Jeremiah never read those words, but his
course over decades proves that singleness need not
stand in the way of a ful?lling life in God’s service.
In fact, it can contribute mightily to a very meaningful life centered on true worship. Though married,
King Zedekiah did not heed Jeremiah’s advice and
“keep living”; whereas the unmarried prophet followed a course that allowed him to do so.
What can you learn from Jeremiah’s example of
maintaining singleness over many decades?
REFRESH AND BE REFRESHED
14

As noted earlier, most men and women in Jere-

miah’s day got married and were part of households.
It was similar in Paul’s day. Undoubtedly, most
Christians with families could not engage in the min14. The relationship between Aquila’s family and Paul highlights what?
128

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

istry abroad as Paul did, but they had much to do locally. That included being a blessing to unmarried
brothers or sisters. Recall that when Paul arrived in
Corinth, Aquila and Priscilla welcomed him into
their home and worked with him at their common
trade. But there was more to it than that. The friendship that Aquila’s family o?ered Paul would certainly have been refreshing. Think of the pleasant meals
together and other occasions of warm human companionship. Did Jeremiah bene?t from similar association? He was using his singleness in God’s service,
yet we need not think of him as a recluse. He could
have enjoyed warm fellowship with families of devoted servants of God, perhaps those of Baruch, Ebedmelech, or others.—Rom. 16:3; read Acts 18:1-3.
15

Single Christians today likewise bene?t from

warm companionship of the sort that Aquila’s family o?ered Paul. If you have a family, do you make
it a point to provide companionship for those who
are unmarried? One sister opened her heart this way:
“I’ve left the world and do not desire to go back.
15. How can Christian families be of great help to unmarried Christians?
Will You “Keep Living,” as Did Jeremiah?

129

However, I still need to be cared about and loved. I
pray that Jehovah will provide additional spiritual
food and encouragement for us single Christians.
We’re not invisible, and not all of us are eager to get
married. Yet, in a way it seems that we’re on our
own. Yes, we can always turn to Jehovah, but when
we need human contact, can we talk with our spiritual family?” Thousands of single brothers and sisters can honestly respond yes. They do enjoy such
human contact in their congregation. Their circle of
friends extends beyond brothers and sisters their
same age. Being people-oriented, they enjoy friendships with those of di?erent ages, including older
ones or the youths in local Christian families.
16

With some forethought, you can be a source of

refreshment to single ones by sometimes including
them in your family activities, such as your evening
of Family Worship. Sharing a family meal with an
unmarried brother or sister can mean far more than
a plate of good food. Could you take the initiative to
16. What simple things might you do to refresh unmarried Christians in
your congregation?
130

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

make an appointment to share in the ministry together? What about inviting a single Christian to
work with your family on a Kingdom Hall maintenance project or occasionally going shopping together? And some families have invited a widow, widower, or single pioneer to join them on a trip to a
convention or a vacation spot. Such association has
proved to be mutually refreshing.
17

Another area to consider regarding unmarried

brothers and sisters relates to the care of aged parents. In Jesus’ day, some prominent Jews craftily
sidestepped caring for their father and mother. They
claimed that ful?lling self-imposed religious obligations came before their God-given obligations toward their parents. (Mark 7:9-13) That should not be
the case in Christian families.—1 Tim. 5:3-8.
18

What, though, when aged parents have a num-

ber of Christian children? If one of the o?spring is
unmarried, must this person inevitably be the primary caregiver? A sister writes from Japan: “I would

like to be married, but because I have the responsibility of caring for my parents, I am unable to get
married. I am con?dent that Jehovah understands
the stress of caring for parents and the pain of heart
felt by single people.” Could it be that she has married brothers and sisters who have decided, without
consulting her, that she must be the one to provide
the care? In cases like these, it is noteworthy that
Jeremiah had brothers who did not treat him fairly.
—Read Jeremiah 12:6.
19

Jehovah understands single people and feels for

those who are experiencing trying circumstances.
(Ps. 103:11-14) However, aged or in?rm parents are
the parents of all their children, not just of those
who are unmarried. Granted, some of the children
may be married and have their own o?spring. However, that does not dissolve the ties of natural a?ection to their parents, nor does it relieve them of their
Christian duty to help when care is needed. We remember that even when Jesus was near death on the
stake, he sensed his duty and acted to care for his
132

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

mother. (John 19:25-27) The Bible does not give detailed rules on sharing the care of elderly or in?rm
parents; nor does it suggest that unmarried children
are automatically more responsible for their care. In
this sensitive ?eld, details need to be worked out
with reasonableness and mutual consideration on
the part of all involved, bearing in mind the example that Jesus set in caring for his mother.
20

Under inspiration, Jeremiah foretold: “They will

no more teach each one his companion and each one
his brother, saying, ‘Know Jehovah!’ for they will all
of them know me.” (Jer. 31:34) In principle, we are
already enjoying such outstanding companionship
in the Christian congregation, including that with
brothers and sisters who are single. Without question, all of us want to ?nd mutual refreshment with
them and to see such unmarried ones “keep living.”

What additional steps might you take to refresh,
and to be refreshed by, some unmarried brothers
or sisters?

CHAPTER NINE

AVOID “S EEKING G REAT
T HINGS FOR YOURSELF ”
BARUCH, the faithful scribe of Jeremiah, had
grown weary. It was the fourth year of the reign of
wicked King Jehoiakim, or about 625 B.C.E. Jeremiah told the scribe to write in a roll of a book all the
words that Jehovah had spoken through the prophet
about Jerusalem and Judah, utterances made over
the 23 years of Jeremiah’s career up till then. (Jer.
25:1-3; 36:1, 2) Baruch did not read the contents of
the scroll to the Jews right then. He would do that
the following year. (Jer. 36:9, 10) But was something
distressing Baruch?
2

“Woe, now, to me,” moaned Baruch, “for Jehovah

has added grief to my pain! I have grown weary because of my sighing.” You have likely had occasion
to make utterances of weariness, whether doing so
audibly or just in your heart. Whichever way Baruch

134

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

did it, Jehovah was listening. The Examiner of human hearts knew what caused Baruch’s troubled
state, and through Jeremiah, God kindly corrected
Baruch. (Read Jeremiah 45:1-5.) You might wonder,
though, why Baruch was feeling so weary. Was it the
assignment he had received or perhaps the circumstances in which he had to perform it? His feelings
really bubbled up from the heart. You see, Baruch
was “seeking great things.” What were they? What
assurance did Jehovah give him if he accepted God’s
counsel and direction? And what can we learn from
Baruch’s experience?
WHAT WERE THO SE “GREAT THINGS”?
3

Baruch must have been aware of what the “great

things” were. The scribe realized that God’s “eyes
are upon the ways of man, and all his steps he sees.”
(Job 34:21) The reason why Baruch felt that he had
“no resting-place” while he transcribed Jeremiah’s
prophetic utterances was not the assignment itself.
It was his own view of what seemed great—what was

Avoid “Seeking Great Things for Yourself”

135

in his heart. Engrossed in seeking “great things” for
himself, Baruch lost sight of the more important
things, those pertaining to doing the divine will.
(Phil. 1:10) The New World Translation brings out the
?avor of the verb used and renders it “keep seeking.”
So it was not a momentary, passing thought. Baruch
had already been seeking “great things” when Jehovah warned him to stop. Though Jeremiah’s faithful
secretary had been sharing in the doing of God’s
will, at the same time, he was yearning for “great
things” for himself.
4

As to what Baruch’s concerns were, one possibil-

ity had to do with fame and prestige. Although Baruch served as a penman for Jeremiah, he might not
have been just a personal secretary to Jeremiah. At
Jeremiah 36:32, Baruch is referred to as “the secretary.” Archaeological evidence suggests that he held
the position of a high royal o?cial. In fact, the same
title is used for “Elishama the secretary,” who was
named among Judah’s princes. This suggests that
4, 5. Why might Baruch’s “great things” have involved fame and prestige,
and why was Jehovah’s warning appropriate?
136

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

Baruch too had access to “the dining room of the
secretary” in “the house of the king” as one of Elishama’s colleagues. (Jer. 36:11, 12, 14) Baruch, then,
must have been an educated o?cial in the royal
household. Seraiah, his brother, held the position of
quartermaster to King Zedekiah and accompanied
the king on an important mission to Babylon. (Read
Jeremiah 51:59.) As quartermaster, Seraiah was likely
in charge of supplies and lodging for the king when
he was traveling, indeed a high-ranking position.
5

You can understand that a person accustomed to

an elevated station might grow weary of recording
denunciatory messages against Judah, one after another. In fact, supporting God’s prophet might have
put at risk Baruch’s position and career. And think
of the consequences if Jehovah tore down what he
had built up, as we read at Jeremiah 45:4. The “great
things” that Baruch had in mind—whether the gaining of additional honor in the royal court or material prosperity—might prove to be in vain. If Baruch
was seeking a secure position in the doomed Jewish
Avoid “Seeking Great Things for Yourself”

137

system of that time, God had reason to restrain him
from that inclination.
6

On the other hand, Baruch’s “great things” might

have included material prosperity. The nations
around Judah relied heavily on possessions and
wealth. Moab trusted in her ‘works and treasures.’
Ammon did likewise. And Jehovah had Jeremiah describe Babylon as “abundant in treasures.” (Jer. 48:
1, 7; 49:1, 4; 51:1, 13) But the fact is, God condemned
those nations.
7

Accordingly, if Baruch was seeking property and

riches, you can appreciate why Jehovah warned him
against that. When God ‘stretched his hand out
against’ the Jews, their houses and ?elds would be
turned over to their enemies. (Jer. 6:12; 20:5) Suppose you had been Baruch’s contemporary living in
Jerusalem. Most of your fellow countrymen—including princes, priests, and the king himself—felt
that they should ?ght against the invading Babylonians. Yet, you learned of Jeremiah’s message:
6, 7. If Baruch’s “great things” centered on material possessions, what
parallels could we consider?
138

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

“Serve the king of Babylon and keep on living.” (Jer.
27:12, 17) Would having a great many possessions
in the city have made it easier for you to obey the
divine direction? Would your feelings about those
belongings have inclined you to heed Jeremiah’s
warning or to follow the course of the majority? Actually, all the valuable things in Judah and Jerusalem, including those in the temple, were pillaged
and taken to Babylon. So striving for material gain
would have been of no use. (Jer. 27:21, 22) Is there
a lesson in that?
How did Jehovah kindly correct Baruch’s inclination to
seek “great things”? Why do you feel that accepting
divine correction is wise?
“I WILL GIVE YOU YOUR S OUL AS A SP OIL”
8

Now consider this aspect: What would Baruch re-

ceive for obeying God’s instruction? Why, his soul!
That was guaranteed “as a spoil” for him. (Read Jeremiah 45:5.) Relatively few people were spared. Who?

139

that is, surrender to, the Chaldeans. (Jer. 21:9; 38:2)
Some may wonder, ‘Was that all they were given for
their obedience?’
9

Well, imagine the state of Jerusalem during the

Babylonian siege. Jerusalem was slowly seared in the
heat of that siege. In contrast, Sodom was overthrown in a moment, so to speak. In a sense, Sodom’s destruction might be said to have been easier
to bear. (Lam. 4:6) Baruch recorded the prophecy
that the inhabitants of Jerusalem were to die by the
sword, by famine, or by pestilence. Then he must
have seen that ful?lled. The food supply in Jerusalem hit rock bottom. What a shock to be in a city
where mothers, who are by nature “compassionate,”
boiled and ate their own children! (Lam. 2:20; 4:10;
Jer. 19:9) Yet, Baruch survived. Yes, amid such turmoil, life itself was a spoil, like a reward to victors
after a battle. Clearly, Baruch must have accepted
and followed the divine counsel not to seek “great
things.” And he won Jehovah’s favor, as his survival
testi?es.—Jer. 43:5-7.
140

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

WILL YOU SEEK “GREAT THINGS”?
10

Although Baruch was busy doing God’s will,

for a time he struggled with a desire for “great
things.” Jehovah warned him of the danger, and he
was saved from spiritual disaster and from physical
death. Could we, like Baruch, be tempted and perhaps overwhelmed by desires deep down in our
heart, even while we are active in serving Jehovah?
11

For Baruch, making a name for himself might

have been a real temptation. Can you imagine him
even wondering: ‘Will I be able to keep my job as
“the secretary”? Might I achieve an even higher of?ce?’ Now, how about us? Ask yourself, ‘Do I have
“ambitions,” maybe ones securely guarded in my
heart, to make a success of a worldly career now or
in the near future?’ Some younger Christians might
ponder the question, ‘Could the prospect of gaining
prestige and ?nancial security through scholastic
achievements lure me into seeking “great things” for
myself?’
10, 11. How does the account of Baruch relate to our day and to us personally?
Avoid “Seeking Great Things for Yourself”

141

12

A brother now serving at world headquarters

was 15 when he was o?ered a scholarship to a university. To his teachers’ dismay, he did not accept
that o?er, preferring a career as a pioneer. Still, his
love for learning never left him. He became a missionary on a remote island. There he had to learn a
language spoken by a little over 10,000 people. There
was no dictionary in that language, so he compiled
a glossary on his own. He eventually mastered the
language and was assigned to translate some of our
Christian publications. Later, the glossary that he
compiled was used as a basis for the ?rst dictionary
in that language. He once told a large audience at a
district convention: “If I had accepted the university education, whatever academic works I accomplished would have been for my own glory. As it is,
I have no secular quali?cation whatsoever. So I do
not get the credit for what I have done. All the credit goes to Jehovah.” (Prov. 25:27) What do you think
of the choice he made when he was 15? Over the
12. How did one brother seek great things for Jehovah, and what is your
opinion of his choice?
142

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

years, he has enjoyed many privileges among God’s
people. In your case, how do you want to use your
talents? Rather than seeking your own glory, are you
determined to use them to praise Jehovah?
13

There is a related danger: seeking “great things”

for or through ones we love and may in?uence. You
have likely seen worldly parents maneuver matters
so that their child achieves more in life than they did
or becomes someone about whom they can boast.
Perhaps you have heard comments like these: “I
don’t want him (or her) to have to work as hard as
I’ve had to” or “I want my child to go to a university so that he’ll have an easier life.” Christian parents could have similar feelings. Granted, a person
might say, ‘I’m not seeking great things for myself.’ But could he be doing so vicariously, that is,
through someone else, a son or a daughter? As Baruch might have been tempted to seek prominence
via his position or career, a parent might inwardly
seek such through the achievements of his o?spring.
13. Why should some parents ponder the challenge Baruch faced?
Avoid “Seeking Great Things for Yourself”

143

Yet, would not “the examiner of hearts” realize this,
just as he did with Baruch? (Prov. 17:3) Should we
not ask God to examine our innermost thoughts, as
David did? (Read Psalm 26:2; Jeremiah 17:9, 10.) Jehovah might use various means, such as this discussion
of Baruch, to alert us to the danger of seeking “great
things.”
What was one possible way that Baruch was seeking “great
things”? What lesson do you see in this?
THE TRAP OF “VALUABLE THINGS”
14

Consider the possibility that Baruch’s “great

things” were material riches. As noted earlier, had
Baruch been deeply attached to his possessions and
properties in Judah, he would probably have had a
hard time obeying the divine command to surrender
to the Chaldeans. You have likely seen that the rich
man often relies on his “valuable things,” but the Bible con?rms that the protection provided by such
things is “in his imagination.” (Prov. 18:11) All of Jehovah’s servants can bene?t from reminding them14, 15. How might riches become “great things” in our case?
144

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

selves of the balanced view of material things expressed in his Word. (Read Proverbs 11:4.) Yet, some
may reason, ‘Why not enjoy a bit of what the world
has to o?er?’
15

Attachment to belongings could lead a Christian

to have a longing for things that are part of a passing system of things. That did not prove to be so
with Jeremiah or Baruch. Years later, Jesus gave a
warning to people living “when the Son of man is to
be revealed.” Jesus told them: “Remember the wife
of Lot.” It would be just as valid to urge Christians:
‘Remember Jeremiah and Baruch.’ (Luke 17:30-33) If
we were to cultivate a strong attachment to material things, it could be hard for us to apply Jesus’
words. But do not forget—Baruch took to heart
God’s warning and stayed alive as a result.
16

Consider the situation of the brothers in Roma-

nia during the Communist regime. While raiding the
homes of Witnesses, government agents sometimes
seized personal belongings, especially things that

145

they could sell. (Lam. 5:2) Many brothers and sisters
under that regime were willing to lose their possessions. Some had to leave behind their belongings and
property when they were relocated; still, they kept
their integrity to Jehovah. If faced with such a test,
will you allow your attachment to material things to
get in the way of your maintaining loyalty to God?
—2 Tim. 3:11.
17

It is noteworthy that Jeremiah and Baruch re-

ceived support from some of their contemporaries.
Zephaniah prophesied during the reign of Josiah,
when Jeremiah was serving as a prophet. What
would the latter have thought about the words we
?nd at Zephaniah 1:18? (Read.) And can you not picture Jeremiah sharing that inspired insight with Baruch? Another contemporary was Ezekiel, who was
taken captive to Babylon in 617 B.C.E. Some of his
activities and messages related directly to the Jews
who were back in their homeland, so Jeremiah likely learned what Ezekiel said or did and vice versa.
17. How might some contemporaries of Jeremiah and Baruch have been
of help to them?
146

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

That would include the words recorded at Ezekiel 7:
19. (Read.) Just as Jeremiah and Baruch could bene?t from those inspired words, so can we. People will
call out to their gods to save them on Jehovah’s day.
Still, neither their gods nor their wealth will save
them.—Jer. 2:28.
WILL YOU RECEIVE “YOUR S OUL AS A SP OIL”?
18

We need to remember that what Jehovah has

promised as a spoil is our “soul.” Even if a few of
his servants perish in the persecution that may come
during “the great tribulation” when the political
horns of the wild beast turn against religion, those
faithful ones will not really have lost out. Their
“soul” is guaranteed to live again to enjoy “the real
life,” in the new world. (Rev. 7:14, 15; 1 Tim. 6:19)
We can rest assured, however, that most of God’s
servants who prove faithful at that time will come
out of the great tribulation. You can be sure that
when God brings calamity against the nations, no

do so?
Avoid “Seeking Great Things for Yourself”

147

faithful one will be among “those slain by Jehovah.”
—Jer. 25:32, 33.
19

Some may ?nd it sobering to think that they

might survive with only their “soul” as a spoil, but
that actually should be no disappointment at all. Recall that while people of Jerusalem were dying from
the famine, Jehovah preserved Jeremiah alive. How?
King Zedekiah put Jeremiah in custody in the Courtyard of the Guard and had him provided with “a
round loaf of bread . . . daily from the street of the
bakers, until all the bread was exhausted from the
city.” (Jer. 37:21) And Jeremiah survived! Jehovah
can use whatever means he chooses to sustain his
people. But sustain his people he will, for their prospect of everlasting life is guaranteed. Baruch survived the destruction of Jerusalem by not “seeking
great things.” Comparably, we can look forward to
surviving Armageddon to praise Jehovah with our
“soul” as a spoil that can be enjoyed endlessly.
19. In what ways did considering the examples of Jeremiah and Baruch
strengthen your determination to avoid seeking “great things” for yourself?

Why is it the sensible course today, not to seek “great
things,” but to look to receive our “soul” as a spoil?
148

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

CHAPTER TEN

A RE YOU DAILY A SKING,
“W HERE I S J EHOVAH?”
JEREMIAH was in tears. He was a?ected both by the
present condition of his people and by what God had
him foretell about their future. He wished that his
head were like a water source and his eyes a fountain
so that he could cry without stopping. Jeremiah had
reason to grieve over the condition of the nation. (Jer.
9:1-3; read Jeremiah 8:20, 21.) The Jews kept rejecting
divine law and did not obey Jehovah’s voice, thus calamity would come.—Jer. 6:19; 9:13.
2

However, the people of Judah, who loved to hear

the ‘all-is-well’ chorus of their religious leaders, were
not genuinely interested in what Jehovah thought of
their conduct. (Jer. 5:31; 6:14) They were like patients
looking for a physician who would say soothing things
but ignore serious symptoms. If you were seriously ill,
would you not want an accurate diagnosis so that you

149

could be treated in time? Spiritually speaking, the
Jews in Jeremiah’s day should have sought an honest
appraisal of their spiritual condition. They ought to
have asked: “Where is Jehovah?”—Jer. 2:6, 8.
3

For the Jews to ask, “Where is Jehovah?” would

have meant seeking divine guidance when faced with
decisions, both major and minor. The Jews at that
time did not do so. But after the desolation of Jerusalem and their return from Babylon, they were to ‘seek
Jehovah’ and ‘search for him.’ By so doing, they would
be able to ?nd him and come to know his ways. (Read
Jeremiah 29:13, 14.) How could they do that? One way
was by approaching God in sincere prayer, asking
for his direction. That was King David’s attitude. He
asked God: “Make me know your own ways, O Jehovah; teach me your own paths.” (Ps. 25:4) Note the invitation that the Hearer of prayer extended through
Jeremiah in the tenth year of King Zedekiah. “Call
to me, and I shall answer you and readily tell you
great and incomprehensible things that you have not

known.” (Jer. 33:3) If the king and the renegade nation
called to God, He could reveal things “incomprehensible” to them, the desolation of Jerusalem and its restoration after 70 years.
4

Another way the Jews could have sought Jehovah

was by searching through history and considering how
he dealt with his people. Thus they could have called
to mind what had gained God’s approval and what had
incurred his wrath. They had Moses’ writings and a
number of inspired historical records as well as the
annals of the kings of Israel and Judah. By meditating
on those and by listening to God’s true prophets, the
Jews in Jeremiah’s day could have grasped the answer
to the question “Where is Jehovah?”
5

A third way those Jews could have sought Jehovah

was by learning through their personal experiences and those of others. Not that they had to learn
everything through trial and error, but they could
have bene?ted from considering what they themselves
had done in the past and how Jehovah viewed the
way they had acted. If they had been observant, they
4, 5. In what other ways could God’s people have sought Jehovah?

151

could have understood how God viewed their conduct.
—Prov. 17:10.
6

But let us bring this down to our day. Have you

been regularly asking, “Where is Jehovah?” when you
are making decisions and choosing your course? Some
may feel that they have not been as conscientious as
they should have been. If in some sense that might be
true of you, do not be downhearted. Even the faithful
patriarch Job struggled in this regard. When he was
under pressure, he was wrapped up in himself. Elihu
had to remind him of the common tendency of mankind: “No one has said, ‘Where is God my Grand Maker?’ ” (Job 35:10) Elihu encouraged Job: “Show yourself attentive to the wonderful works of God.” (Job
37:14) Job needed to observe the mighty works of Jehovah in the creation around him and in God’s dealings with humans. Through his own experience, Job
came to understand Jehovah’s ways. After he had endured his ordeal and had seen how Jehovah handled
the matter, Job said: “I talked, but I was not understanding things too wonderful for me, which I do not

know. In hearsay I have heard about you, but now my
own eye does see you.”—Job 42:3, 5.
7

As for Jeremiah himself, the prophet continued to

seek Jehovah and was able to ?nd him. Unlike his
countrymen, over the decades of his faithful service,
Jeremiah kept asking: “Where is Jehovah?” In what
follows in this chapter, we will see from Jeremiah’s example how we can seek Jehovah and ?nd him through
prayer, study, and personal experiences.—1 Chron.
28:9.
7. What are we going to discuss next?

What does it mean to ask, “Where is Jehovah?”
In what ways could the Jews of Jeremiah’s
day have asked that?
JEREMIAH TURNED TO JEHOVAH IN PRAYER
8

Over the years while serving as God’s mouthpiece

to the nation of Judah, Jeremiah sought Jehovah
through heartfelt prayers. He turned to God for support when he had to proclaim unpopular messages,
when he felt that he could not continue, and when he
had questions about why certain things took place.

153

God answered him and gave direction as to how to
proceed. Consider a few examples.
9

Once when Jeremiah was given a denunciatory

message to proclaim, he felt that everyone was calling
down evil upon him. So the prophet called on God
to remember him. Consider his prayer, recorded at
Jeremiah 15:15, 16, in which he tells how he felt about
the divine response. (Read.) In that prayer, Jeremiah
expressed his feelings of anguish. Yet, when he found
God’s words and put them in his mouth, as it were, he
became joyful! Jehovah helped him to appreciate the
privilege of bearing the divine name and proclaiming
a divine message. Jeremiah could clearly see where Jehovah was in this matter. What lesson is there in that
for us?

154

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

(Read Jeremiah 20:8, 9.) The Bible does not tell us that
God responded by speaking to Jeremiah from heaven.
But God’s word became like a burning ?re shut up in
his bones, and he could not help but declare it. Indeed,
by honestly expressing himself before God and allowing himself to be moved by what he knew of His will,
Jeremiah was motivated to follow through on what
God wanted him to do.
11

Jeremiah had a vexing question when he observed

the wicked succeed. (Read Jeremiah 12:1, 3.) Though
not at all questioning Jehovah’s righteousness, the
prophet sought a response to his “complaint.” His
forthrightness made it clear that he had a strong bond
with God, much like that of a child with his beloved
father. It was just that Jeremiah did not understand
why many Jews were prospering despite being wicked.
Did Jeremiah get a satisfying answer? Jehovah assured
him that He would uproot the wicked. (Jer. 12:14) As
Jeremiah saw the outworking of the matters he took
to God in prayer, his con?dence in divine justice must

155

have deepened. As a result, Jeremiah must have increasingly turned to God in prayer, expressing himself
to his Father.
12

Near the end of Zedekiah’s reign, when the Bab-

ylonians were laying siege to Jerusalem, Jeremiah referred to Jehovah as someone “whose eyes are opened
upon all the ways of the sons of men, in order to give
to each one according to his ways and according to the
fruitage of his dealings.” (Jer. 32:19) Jeremiah could
see where Jehovah stands on the matter of justice, that
God is indeed watching over what each one is doing
and hearing the earnest prayers of his servants. And,
correspondingly, they would see more and more evidence that He gives to “each one according to his ways
and according to the fruitage of his dealings.”
13

We may not feel that we have any doubt about

God’s justice and the wisdom of how he both accomplishes and will yet accomplish his will. Nevertheless,
we can bene?t from re?ecting on what Jeremiah went
through and bringing up in our prayers how we feel at
heart. Our expressing ourselves in that way can re13. Why are you con?dent of the outworking of God’s will?
156

inforce our con?dence in Jehovah, that his will is certainly going to be accomplished. Even if we do not fully understand at present why things are developing as
they are, or why God’s will is proceeding at the rate it
is, we can express in prayer to him our con?dence that
he is in complete control. His will is going to take
place in the way and at the pace he knows is best. This
is guaranteed; we have no reason to doubt it. We will
continue to ask, “Where is Jehovah?” in the sense of
prayerfully seeking to comprehend his will and to see
evidence of its outworking.—Job 36:5-7, 26.
What assurance do you derive from Jeremiah’s
experiences in seeking Jehovah in prayer?
JEREMIAH FED HIS HEART WITH KNOWLED GE
14

In connection with the question, “Where is Jeho-

vah?” Jeremiah was well-aware of the need for ‘knowledge of Jehovah.’ (Jer. 9:24) He must have studied the
history of God’s people as he compiled the books now
known as 1 and 2 Kings. He speci?cally mentioned
“the book of the a?airs of Solomon,” “the book of the
14. How do we know that Jeremiah researched the history of God’s people?

157

a?airs of the days of the kings of Israel,” and “the book
of the a?airs of the days of the kings of Judah.” (1 Ki.
11:41; 14:19; 15:7) Accordingly, he came to understand
how Jehovah had dealt with various situations. Jeremiah could see what pleased Jehovah and how He
viewed people’s decisions. He could also consult inspired writings available at the time, such as those
by Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, and Solomon. No
doubt, he was knowledgeable about the earlier prophets as well as his contemporaries. How did Jeremiah’s
personal study bene?t him?
15

Jeremiah recorded the account about Jezebel, the

wicked wife of King Ahab of Samaria. His account included Elijah’s declaration that dogs would eat up Jezebel in the plot of the land of Jezreel. (1 Ki. 21:23) And
in harmony with what Jeremiah recorded, you know
that some 18 years later, Jezebel was thrown out of a
window, trampled upon by Jehu’s horse, and eaten by
dogs. (2 Ki. 9:31-37) Research into Elijah’s prophecy and its ful?llment, even in its details, must have

158

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

strengthened Jeremiah’s faith in God’s word. Indeed,
behind his perseverance as a prophet was faith that
had been built up by his study of Jehovah’s past activities.
16

Let us take another example. What do you think

enabled Jeremiah—despite being persecuted—to keep
on warning such wicked kings as Jehoiakim and Zedekiah? A major reason was that Jehovah made Jeremiah “a forti?ed city and an iron pillar and copper walls”
toward the kings of Judah. (Jer. 1:18, 19) But let us not
overlook the fact that Jeremiah had done extensive research into the reigns of earlier kings of Judah and Israel. He had made a record of the fact that Manasseh
had built “altars to all the army of the heavens in two
courtyards of the house of Jehovah,” had sacri?ced his
own son in the ?re, and had shed innocent blood in
very great quantity. (2 Ki. 21:1-7, 16; read Jeremiah
15:4.) Yet, Jeremiah must have known that when Manasseh humbled himself and kept praying to Jehovah,
“He let himself be entreated,” and Jehovah restored
the king to his place.—Read 2 Chronicles 33:12, 13.
16, 17. Why do you think Jeremiah could persevere in warning the wicked kings of his day?
Are You Daily Asking, “Where Is Jehovah?”

159

17

In his writings, Jeremiah did not mention Jeho-

vah’s mercy toward Manasseh. But Manasseh died
only 15 years or so before Jeremiah embarked on
his prophetic career. Hence, the prophet must have
heard about what happened when the king repented
of his past wickedness. Researching Manasseh’s terrible conduct and the outcome must have helped Jeremiah to see the value of urging kings, such as Zedekiah, to seek Jehovah’s mercy and loving-kindness. Even
a king notorious for idolatry and bloodshed could repent and be forgiven. If you had been in Jeremiah’s situation, would the events involving Manasseh have encouraged you, giving you reason to persevere during
the reigns of other bad kings?
LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE
18

During his career as a prophet, Jeremiah certain-

ly learned from seeing how his contemporaries acted
in given situations. One was the prophet Urijah, who
prophesied against Jerusalem and Judah during the

answer?
160

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

reign of Jehoiakim. However, out of fear of King Jehoiakim, Urijah ?ed to Egypt. Thereafter, the king
sent men to bring him back from Egypt, and then he
had Urijah killed. (Jer. 26:20-23) Do you think Jeremiah learned a lesson from the experience of Urijah? The fact that Jeremiah kept warning the Jews of
their impending doom—even doing so in the temple
area—proves that he must have learned a lesson. Jeremiah maintained his courage, and Jehovah did not
abandon him. God must have moved Ahikam, Shaphan’s son, to protect the life of courageous Jeremiah.—Jer. 26:24.
19

Jeremiah also learned from his own experience of

being used by Jehovah to warn His people. In the
fourth year of King Jehoiakim, Jehovah told Jeremiah
to write down all the words that He had spoken from
Josiah’s day to that time. What was the reason for this
divine direction? It was to encourage individuals to
turn from doing bad and be forgiven. (Read Jeremiah
36:1-3.) Jeremiah, who got up early to give warning
19. Jeremiah could see what from Jehovah’s persistence in sending prophets to His people?

161

messages from God, even pleaded with the people to
end their detestable practices. (Jer. 44:4) Is it not clear
that Jeremiah must have realized from his own experience that God had sent the prophets out of compassion for His people? And would that not have engendered compassion in Jeremiah himself ? (2 Chron.
36:15) You can understand, then, that when Jeremiah
survived Jerusalem’s destruction, he could say: “It is
the acts of loving-kindness of Jehovah that we have
not come to our ?nish, because his mercies will certainly not come to an end. They are new each morning.”—Lam. 3:22, 23.
How must Jeremiah have been a?ected by researching
God’s past dealings and meditating on what he and others
had experienced? What can we learn from this?
D O YOU DAILY ASK, “WHERE IS JEHOVAH?”
20

In the decisions that you face daily, do you make

it a point to seek out what is God’s will, to ask, “Where
is Jehovah?” (Jer. 2:6-8) Unlike the Jews in his day, Jeremiah always looked to the Almighty for help in discerning which way he should go. Imitating Jeremiah

162

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

in daily seeking Jehovah’s view is undoubtedly the
wise course for each of us when making a decision.
21

The decision does not have to be regarding a ma-

jor issue or a turning point in life. For example, what
of the decision to go out in the ?eld ministry on the
day you planned? Perhaps you wake up and note an
overcast sky, which may not be inviting. The territory
scheduled for house-to-house witnessing that day may
have been covered repeatedly. You may recall that
some of the people turned you away with feigned politeness or with outright rudeness. At that early point
in the day, could you ask in prayer, “Where is Jehovah?” Doing so might help you to think of the beauty
of the message you will bear and to sense more deeply that it is God’s will that you declare that message.
You then might feel the word of Jehovah becoming a
source of joy and exultation for you, as it was for Jeremiah. (Jer. 15:16, 20) If later during your ministry
you meet someone who is very harsh or even threatening, you can again express your feelings in prayer to

God. Will you? Do not forget that he can provide holy
spirit so that you can respond appropriately, and your
desire to speak God’s message will overpower negative feelings.—Luke 12:11, 12.
22

It is good to be aware that some prayers can be

hampered, or blocked. (Read Lamentations 3:44.) Jehovah did not listen to the prayers of the rebellious Jews
because they were ‘turning their ear away from him’
and persisting in a practice of lawlessness. (Prov. 28:9)
The lesson must have been clear to Jeremiah, as it
should be to us: If a person fails to act in harmony with
his or her prayers, that will disappoint God and can
result in His ceasing to hear the prayers. Surely, that
is something we should seek to avoid at all costs.
23

In addition to sincere prayer for Jehovah’s direc-

tion, we need to continue in our personal study, a key
means of ?nding out Jehovah’s will. In this, we have
an advantage over Jeremiah. We have the complete
Bible. Like Jeremiah, who did deep research to compile his inspired historic account, you can rove about

you put trust in him, and you “will certainly become
like a tree planted by the waters, that sends out its
roots right by the watercourse.”—Read Jeremiah 17:5-8.
24

As you read and meditate on the Holy Scriptures,

try to discern what Jehovah wants you to do in various situations. You can look for principles that you
want to remember and apply in your life. While reading historical accounts, divine commands, godly principles, and wise sayings in God’s Word, consider how
those passages should in?uence your daily decisions.
In response to your asking, “Where is Jehovah?” he
can reveal to you by means of his written Word how
to deal with even dire situations you might face. Why,
you may see in the Bible the “incomprehensible things
that you have not known” or sensed in a certain light!
—Jer. 33:3.

your situation, do not think that the Most High does
not care about you. He does, just as he cared about
Jeremiah.
26

As you meditate on Jehovah’s dealings with indi-

viduals today, you will realize that he is providing daily guidance in various ways. Aki, a young sister in Japan, felt that she was unworthy of being a Christian.
One day when in ?eld service with the circuit overseer’s wife, Aki expressed herself: “I feel that Jehovah
is about to spew me out of his mouth, but I am hanging on to his lips, asking him to give me a little more
time.” The circuit overseer’s wife looked her in the eye
and said: “I’ve never felt that you were a lukewarm
Christian!” Later, Aki mulled over that reassuring
comment. In fact, there was no real indication that Jehovah had ever viewed her as lukewarm. Thereafter,
166

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

Aki prayed to Jehovah: “Send me wherever you wish.
I will do whatever you want me to do.” About that
time, she visited a foreign land where there was a small
Japanese group that needed someone who spoke the
language and who could stay and serve with them. It
so happened that Aki had been born in that land,
which made it easy for her to move there and help. But
where could she live? A sister whose daughter had just
relocated o?ered a room. “It was just like pieces of a
jigsaw puzzle falling into place; Jehovah was opening
the way for me,” Aki concluded.
27

Many brothers and sisters can relate instances in

which they personally felt God’s guidance, perhaps as
they did Bible reading or personal study. You too may
have had similar experiences. Such should strengthen
your bond with Jehovah and move you to approach
him in prayer even more frequently and fervently.
Trust that as we daily keep asking, “Where is Jehovah?” he will show us his way.—Isa. 30:21.

CHAPTER ELEVEN

“S HEPHERDS IN A GREEMENT
W ITH M Y H EART ”
HIROYASU was a small boy in Japan when his
mother bought a ram and a ewe. He looked after
them, and the ewe produced two lambs a year, so the
?ock began to grow. By the time he was 12, there
were 12 or 13 sheep. “Early one morning while I was
still in bed,” he recalls, “I heard them bleating. I
didn’t go out at once. When I ?nally did, I saw a
pack of wild dogs running away from my lambs,
which had their bellies ripped open. Frantically, I
searched for the mother sheep. I found her, still
breathing, in a pool of blood. Only the ram survived.
I was heartbroken. I should have gone to check on
the ?ock when I ?rst heard them. They were defenseless against the dogs.”
2

In Bible times, almost everyone was familiar with

the work of a shepherd. His job was to lead his ?ock

work of a shepherd in Bible times consisted of what?
168

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

to pastures and ensure that the animals in his care
were well-fed. He also protected them against predators and searched for strays. (1 Sam. 17:34-36) The
shepherd had his ?ock lie down to rest, undisturbed.
He also assisted in the birth of lambs and then
looked after these. Many Bible writers, including Jeremiah, used the ?gure of a shepherd as a metaphor
for a man charged with the care of people, either as
their ruler or as their spiritual overseer.
3

Some in the Christian congregation may think of

the elders as shepherds only when these men visit
their brothers to help and encourage them. However,
from the way Jeremiah used the terms “shepherd”
and “shepherding,” we can see that he applied them
to all aspects of the relationship between Judah’s
overseers and the people. God often condemned the
princes, prophets, and priests in Judah as bad shepherds because they were not seeking the best interests of the common people. (Jer. 2:8) They mistreated, misled, and neglected their “sheep” while

sel?shly pursuing their own interests. God’s people
were left in a shocking state of spiritual neglect. Jehovah pronounced “woe” on those false shepherds,
and he assured his people that he would give them
caring, attentive shepherds who would really protect
the ?ock.—Read Jeremiah 3:15; 23:1-4.
4

God’s promise had a major ful?llment in the

Chief Shepherd of Jehovah’s sheep, Jesus, who became the Head of the Christian congregation. He
called himself “the ?ne shepherd,” one who showed
real compassion for those whom he led. (John 10:1115) Today, Jehovah is using undershepherds to care
for his earthly ?ock, both anointed brothers of the
faithful and discreet slave class as well as conscientious elders of the “great crowd.” (Rev. 7:9) These
shepherds strive to re?ect Jesus’ self-sacri?cing spirit. They want to feed and cherish the congregation, in imitation of Christ. Woe to any who neglect or lord it over their brothers or who adopt
a harsh or arrogant attitude toward them! (Matt.
20:25-27; 1 Pet. 5:2, 3) What is Jehovah looking for
4. Who is caring for God’s ?ock today, and with what spirit?
170

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

in Christian shepherds today? What can we learn
from Jeremiah’s writings about appropriate attitudes
and motives for elders to have as they care for their
responsibilities? Let us examine their roles as providers of help and protective care, as teachers inside
and outside the congregation, and as judges.
PROVIDING PROTECTIVE CARE
5

The apostle Peter called Jehovah “the shepherd

and overseer of [our] souls.” (1 Pet. 2:25) What attitude does God display toward his “sheep”? We ?nd
an answer by looking back to Jeremiah’s day. After
criticizing the bad shepherds, who scattered and neglected the ?ock, Jehovah said that he would “collect” his sheep, bringing them back to their pasture
ground. He promised to appoint over them good
shepherds, ‘who would actually shepherd them’ and
see to it that his people were protected from rapacious enemies. (Jer. 23:3, 4) Yes, Jehovah’s sheep
were precious to him. His sheep today are precious

171

too. He has paid a high price in behalf of their everlasting welfare.—1 Pet. 1:18, 19.
6

Like literal shepherds, Christian overseers should

not be negligent in caring for the congregation. If
you serve as an elder, are you striving to be alert to
any sign of su?ering on the part of your brothers,
and are you willing to assist them promptly? Wise
King Solomon wrote: “You ought to know positively
the appearance of your ?ock. Set your heart to your
droves.” (Prov. 27:23) That verse extols the industriousness of literal shepherds; yet, in principle it may
be applied to the care provided by spiritual shepherds in the congregation. If you serve as an elder,
are you consciously ?ghting against any tendency to
dominate others? The very fact that Peter mentioned
“lording it over those who are God’s inheritance”
proves that it is distinctly possible for an elder to do
so. How can you help to accomplish what is described at Jeremiah 33:12? (Read.) Single parents,
widows, stepfamilies, the elderly, and youngsters may
have special need of attention and help.
7

As a shepherd may do with literal sheep, a con-

172

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

gregation shepherd sometimes needs to search out
and help individuals who, for one reason or another, have strayed from the ?ock. His doing so will call
for self-sacri?ce and humility. He patiently spends
time caring for the needs of those entrusted to his
oversight. Congregation elders would do well to ask
themselves frankly: ‘To what extent am I striving to
encourage and upbuild rather than condemn or criticize? Do I honestly want to do better?’ Repeated efforts may sometimes be required to help one see
things from God’s perspective. If a brother or a sister hesitates to accept Scriptural counsel (not just a
personal opinion), remember the Supreme Shepherd
and Overseer, Jehovah. He patiently “kept speaking”
to and striving to help his wayward people. (Jer. 25:
3-6) Most of God’s people today do not practice bad
things, but when counsel is required, an elder must
o?er it as did Jehovah.
8

While there was still hope that fellow Jews might

return to Jehovah, Jeremiah prayed for them. He
said to God: “Remember my standing before you to
8. How may spiritual shepherds imitate Jeremiah’s example?
“Shepherds in Agreement With My Heart”

173

speak good even concerning them, to turn back your
rage from them.” (Jer. 18:20) You can see from these
words that Jeremiah was looking for the good in his
brothers, not thinking ill of them. Today, Christian
overseers should imitate Jeremiah’s attitude until
there is clear evidence that a person has unrepentantly set his heart to do what is bad. A positive step
is to commend others for the good they are doing
and to pray for them and with them.—Matt. 25:21.
What promise did God make through Jeremiah regarding
spiritual shepherds? How can Christian overseers provide
protective care?
“THEY WILL CERTAINLY FEED YOU”
9

In harmony with what we read at Jeremiah 3:

15, Christian shepherds are to “feed [others] with
knowledge and insight,” that is, to serve as teachers.
(1 Tim. 3:2; 5:17) Jehovah promised his people that
the good shepherds would do that. And he encouraged the Jews to accept the corrective teaching from
his prophet Jeremiah. (Read Jeremiah 6:8.) To be
9, 10. Why does being a good shepherd (congregation elder) mean being
a teacher?
174

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

healthy, sheep need nourishment. Comparably, to remain spiritually healthy, God’s people need Scriptural feeding and direction.
10

When it comes to teaching, elders have a twofold

role—that of helping those who are already in the
congregation and that of helping those who are not
yet true Christians. As to the latter, remember: One
of the chief reasons that the Christian congregation
exists is to preach the good news of God’s Kingdom. Accordingly, elders must be zealous evangelizers. (Jer. 1:7-10) As such, they both ful?ll their own
responsibility toward God and set a ?ne example for
their brothers. If you are an elder, do you not ?nd
that regularly preaching side by side with various
brothers and sisters gives you the opportunity to
help them re?ne their teaching abilities and to re?ne
your own? And when you zealously take the lead
in evangelizing, you are giving vital encouragement,
which can help the whole congregation to progress.
11

What elders share in dispensing to the congre-

gation must be based on the Bible; thus, it will
11, 12. An elder who wants to be a good shepherd must give attention to
what?
“Shepherds in Agreement With My Heart”

175

be wholesome spiritual food. You can appreciate,
then, that in order to be e?ective teachers, congregation shepherds must be zealous students of God’s
Word. Contrast this with what Jeremiah pointed out
as to why the leaders of his people were ine?ective: “The shepherds have behaved unreasoningly,
and they have not looked even for Jehovah. That is
why they have not acted with insight, and all their
pastured animals have been scattered.” (Jer. 10:21)
Those who should have been teachers were not following Scriptural principles and were not searching
for God. Hence, they could not act with true wisdom.
Jeremiah proclaimed an even stronger denunciation
of the so-called prophets.—Read Jeremiah 14:14, 15.
12

Unlike those false shepherds, Christian overseers

study and imitate Jesus’ example. Thus, they can
serve as wise shepherds of the ?ock. It can be a challenge for them to schedule such study regularly, given the diverse demands on their time and attention.
But if you serve as an elder, are you ?rmly convinced
that your instruction can be bene?cial and true, re176

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

?ecting knowledge and insight, only when you base
it on God’s Word and direction from the faithful and
discreet slave class? If you sense that you are not as
involved in a personal study program as you were
previously, what will you do so that you can continue to be di?erent from the false shepherds of Jeremiah’s day?
13

Something that made Jeremiah particularly e?ec-

tive as a teacher was his use of illustrations. Of
course, he was instructed by Jehovah. How memorable it would have been to see him dash an earthenware pot to the ground and proclaim that in
the same way, Jerusalem and its people would be
smashed! (Jer. 19:1, 10, 11) Another example is that
Jeremiah made and wore a wooden yoke to denote his people’s su?ering the severe bondage of
submission to Babylon. (Jer., chaps. 27-28) The elders in your congregation have not been directed by
God to carry out such dramatic actions to illustrate points. Yet, do you not appreciate it when
13. What helped Jeremiah to be a good teacher, and what can Christian
shepherds today learn from him?
“Shepherds in Agreement With My Heart”

177

they weave appropriate illustrations and experiences
into their teaching? Truly well-thought-out and appropriate word pictures and examples can be both
powerful and motivating.
14

How thankful we can be for the teaching done

by Christian shepherds! In his day, Jeremiah saw
the need for the spiritual healing of his people. He
asked: “Is there no balsam in Gilead? Or is there no
healer there?” (Jer. 8:22) There was literal balsam
in Gilead, the part of Israel east of the Jordan.
This aromatic plant oil was renowned for its medicinal properties, often being applied to soothe and
cure wounds. However, there was no spiritual healing. Why? Jeremiah observed: “The prophets themselves actually prophesy in falsehood; and as for the
priests, they go subduing according to their powers.
And my own people have loved it that way.” (Jer. 5:
31) What about today? Can you not agree that there
de?nitely is “balsam in Gilead”—yes, in your congregation? We can liken soothing balsam to the comfort

5:14, 15.
What aspects of the teaching by elders in your congregation
do you especially appreciate? What makes their teaching
e?ective?
“THIS IS WHAT JEHOVAH HAS SAID”
15

Imagine the joy of a literal shepherd whose hard

work and long hours are rewarded by the birth of
healthy lambs! He knows, though, that to thrive,
those lambs will need attention. The shepherd has
to ensure that they get proper nourishment. Lambs
are born with long tails that may drag in manure and
dirt. The shepherd wants his animals to remain clean
and healthy, so he may shorten their tails, doing so
skillfully to avoid causing unnecessary pain. Spiritual shepherds too give loving attention to the sheep,
the members of their congregation. (John 21:16, 17)
The elders are also overjoyed to see interested ones

taking steps to become true Christians. Christian
overseers want all the sheep, young and old, to be
healthy and properly fed, so they do not let up in giving them attention, intervening when needed. This
work certainly includes reminding their brothers of
“what Jehovah has said,” that is, what the Scriptures
teach.—Jer. 2:2, 5; 7:5-7; 10:2; Titus 1:9.
16

Jeremiah needed boldness to announce God’s

message. So do congregation overseers, particularly
in cases where they must speak up to protect their
brothers. It may be, for example, that a spiritual
shepherd sees the need to intervene to prevent a
‘newborn lamb’ or even an older “sheep” from getting befouled by the dirt of Satan’s world. The one
in danger may not even be seeking counsel. Still,
could a conscientious shepherd just stand by observing as a member of his ?ock walks into trouble? Of
course not! Nor would he treat such a situation lightly, pretending that all is well when obviously it is not
and could result in a fellow servant’s losing his or
her peace with Jehovah.—Jer. 8:11.
180

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

17

If an unwary sheep were to be induced to wan-

der away from the ?ock, an alert shepherd would be
quick to direct it back to safety. (Read Jeremiah 50:
6, 7.) Similarly, on occasion an overseer might have
to reason ?rmly but lovingly with ones who are wandering into dangerous situations. For instance, he
might note that an engaged couple are spending time
together without a chaperone in places where their
passions might overwhelm them. A kind and understanding elder could help the couple to avoid such
compromising circumstances. While being careful to
avoid accusing them, he might highlight possibilities
that could lead to conduct that Jehovah hates. As
Jeremiah did, faithful elders condemn what God condemns. In this they imitate Jehovah, who, though not
harsh, pleaded with his people through his prophet:
“Do not do, please, this detestable sort of thing that
I have hated.” (Jer. 5:7; 25:4, 5; 35:15; 44:4) Do you
truly appreciate the concern that loving shepherds
show for the ?ock?
17. When and how might a shepherd have to give special attention to individual sheep?
“Shepherds in Agreement With My Heart”

181

18

Of course, not all those whom Jeremiah coun-

seled listened to him. But some did. For example,
when Baruch, Jeremiah’s companion and secretary,
needed vigorous counsel, Jeremiah willingly gave it.
(Jer. 45:5) With what result? Baruch enjoyed God’s
favor and survived Jerusalem’s destruction. Likewise
today, positive results in helping fellow believers can
encourage congregation elders to ‘continue applying
themselves’ to lifesaving ‘exhortation and teaching.’
—1 Tim. 4:13, 16.
DIS CIPLINE “TO THE PROPER DEGREE”
19

Another role of overseers today is that of spir-

itual judges. On rare occasions, elders may have
to deal with those who are willful sinners, wanting to lead them to repentance. Jehovah kindly but
straightforwardly encouraged wrongdoers to leave
their bad ways. (Jer. 4:14) If a person in the congregation will not abandon a sinful course, however,
overseers must act to protect the ?ock from a potentially corrupting in?uence. As the Scriptures direct,

182

they may have to expel the wrongdoer. Jehovah expects elders to uphold divine justice in such circumstances. Good King Josiah was exemplary in doing
so. “He pleaded the legal claim of the a?icted one
and the poor one.” He was imitating God’s love of
justice. Thus, Jehovah could ask regarding Josiah’s
actions: “Was not that a case of knowing me?” Because Josiah executed justice and righteousness, “it
went well with him.” Do you not feel more secure
when the elders in your congregation strive to imitate Josiah’s example?—Jer. 22:11, 15, 16.
20

Be con?dent that Jehovah disciplines wrongdo-

ers “to the proper degree.” (Jer. 46:28) Accordingly, depending on the circumstances and the attitude manifested, the elders may have to counsel,
exhort, or reprove fellow believers. And it may
even be necessary to disfellowship an unrepentant
wrongdoer. In that case, elders do not pray publicly
for one who is expelled and is pursuing a sinful
course; it would be pointless to do so.1 (Jer. 7:9, 16)
They will, however, imitate God by showing the

disfellowshipped person how he can return to God’s
favor. (Read Jeremiah 33:6-8.) Although disfellowshipping may be painful, we can be sure that God’s standards are righteous and just and the best for all.
—Lam. 1:18.
21

When congregation shepherds identify and apply

the inspired divine standards, the ?ock will be nourished, healthy, and well-protected. (Ps. 23:1-6) What
Jeremiah tells us about attitudes and motives, both
those that are appropriate and those that are not,
can be useful to Christian overseers as they ful?ll the serious responsibility of caring for God’s
sheep. Hence, each of us can ask, ‘Will I continue
to show appreciation for Jehovah’s arrangement to
teach, guide, and protect his people by supporting
shepherds who “actually shepherd” the ?ock “with
knowledge and insight”?’—Jer. 3:15; 23:4.

CHAPTER TWELVE

“WAS N OT T HAT A C ASE
OF K NOWING M E?”
KING JEHOIAKIM was building a house, and it
was to be grand. Plans called for spacious rooms on
at least two stories. Large windows would allow sunshine to pour through as well as a constant ?ow of
fresh air to keep the king and his family comfortable. The walls were to be paneled in aromatic cedar
from Lebanon. Vermilion, an imported paint, would
give the interior the rich red ?nish that was muchsought-after by the high and mighty of other lands.
—Jer. 22:13, 14.
2

The cost of the project was considerable. About

that time, the nation’s defense and the demands from
Egypt for tribute had apparently depleted the treasury. (2 Ki. 23:33-35) But Jehoiakim found a way to
pay for his new palace. He held back the wages of
the construction workers! Jehoiakim treated them

like slaves, using their sweat and toil as a contribution toward his monarchy.
3

Through Jeremiah, God condemned Jehoiakim

for his sel?shness.1 He reminded the king that his
father, King Josiah, had shown extraordinary kindness and generosity toward the working class and
the poor. Josiah had even pleaded their legal cases
in court. Calling Jehoiakim’s attention to Josiah’s
consideration for the lowly, Jehovah asked: “Was
not that a case of knowing me?”—Read Jeremiah 22:
15, 16.
4

As conditions deteriorate in Satan’s world, we

need the help and protection that Jehovah gives to
those who know him intimately. Thus, we should
draw ever closer to God. We also need to re?ect his
?ne qualities to have success in preaching the good
news. You might wonder, though, ‘How can a Christian get to know Jehovah as well as King Josiah
did?’

of this book.

WHAT KNOWING G OD MEANS
5

Think of the ways that a good father in?uences

the lives of his children. For example, when they observe how he shares with others who are less fortunate, they are likely moved to be openhanded. Their
seeing how he treats their mother with love and respect will probably help them become considerate
toward those of the opposite sex. They hear that
their father is known to be fair and honest in money matters, which ought to move them to be fair and
honest. Yes, by their coming to know their father’s
ways and qualities, such young ones will probably
grow up wanting to treat others as their father does.
6

In like manner, a Christian who knows Jehovah

as Josiah did does not simply recognize Him as Universal Sovereign. By reading the Bible, the Christian
comes to know how God treats others, and then he
wants to imitate his heavenly Father. His love for Jehovah deepens as day by day he re?ects God’s likes
and dislikes. In contrast, a person who ignores God’s

laws and reminders, thus rejecting any divine in?uence in his life, does not come to know the true God.
He is similar to Jehoiakim, who threw into the ?re
Jehovah’s word through Jeremiah.—Read Jeremiah
36:21-24.
7

Our success in sacred service and our prospects

for life in the new world depend on our truly knowing Jehovah. (Jer. 9:24) Let us examine a few of
God’s qualities as revealed in Jeremiah’s writings.
During this consideration of God’s personality, look
for ways that you personally can both know him and
imitate him as King Josiah did.

“TO TIME INDEFINITE IS HIS

The facet of God’s personality known as loving-

kindness, or loyal love, de?es concise de?nition in
many languages. According to one Bible dictionary,
the Hebrew term involved describes the interaction of
8. What is loving-kindness?
188

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

strength, steadfastness, and love. That dictionary goes
on to say: “Any understanding of the word that fails to
suggest all three inevitably loses some of its richness.”
Thus, someone showing loving-kindness is more than
a nice person. With deep concern, he tries to help others satisfy their needs, especially their spiritual needs,
as best he can. His main reason for acting in such a
sel?ess manner is his desire to please Almighty God.
9

The best way to grasp the essence of the Bibli-

cal expression “loving-kindness” is by studying how
God treated his true worshippers down through
the ages. Jehovah protected and fed the Israelites
while they spent 40 years in the wilderness. In the
Promised Land, God provided judges to rescue them
from their enemies and to bring them back to true
worship. Because Jehovah stuck with them through
good times and bad during all those centuries, he
could tell the nation: “With a love to time inde?nite
I have loved you. That is why I have drawn you with
loving-kindness.”—Jer. 31:3.1
1 The New English Bible renders Jehovah’s words: “I have dearly loved
you from of old, and still I maintain my unfailing care for you.”

9. What did Jehovah’s treatment of Israel prove?
“Was Not That a Case of Knowing Me?”

189

10

In our day, God continues to show loving-

kindness in ways that directly bene?t his worshippers. Consider the matter of prayer. Jehovah takes
note of all sincere prayers, but he pays special attention when his dedicated servants pray to him. Even
if for years we keep praying about the same chronic
problems, he does not lose patience with us; nor
does he tire of hearing our prayers. Once, Jehovah
had Jeremiah send a message to a group of Jews already captive in Babylon. They were over 500 miles
away from the temple, far from family and friends in
Judah. Their being far from the temple, however, did
not keep Jehovah from hearing their requests for his
favor and their expressions of praise. Bearing in
mind your sincere prayers, think of the comfort the
Jews felt when they heard God’s words, as found at
Jeremiah 29:10-12.—Read.
11

We see another evidence of Jehovah’s loving-

kindness in his positive outlook. As the fall of Jeru10. As illustrated with the Jews in Babylon, how does Jehovah show lovingkindness in the way that he listens to prayers?

salem approached and the city’s inhabitants continued their rebellion, which amounted to a rebellion
against God, what did the future hold for them? Perhaps death from famine or a Babylonian sword? At
best, they might experience a long exile and death in
a foreign land. Jehovah, however, held out a positive
“good word” for those who repented and changed
their lives. He promised to ‘turn his attention’ to
them. He would bring them “back to this place,”
their homeland, from faraway Babylon. (Jer. 27:22)
As a result, they would cry out: “Laud Jehovah of armies, for Jehovah is good; for to time inde?nite is
his loving-kindness!”—Jer. 33:10, 11.
12

Because of his loving-kindness, Jehovah is a

Source of encouragement to those who are in dire
circumstances from a human standpoint. There are
some today who were once part of the Christian congregation but who received needed and just discipline. They may feel overwhelmed by guilt and now
hesitate to renew their association with God’s people. They may wonder whether Jehovah could ever
forgive them and receive them back. Almighty God
“Was Not That a Case of Knowing Me?”

191

has a “good word” for all such ones. They can receive kind help to make any needed changes in their
thinking and practices. And what we read in the preceding paragraph can in principle apply to them—Jehovah will ‘restore them to their place’ among his
happy people.—Jer. 31:18-20.
13

As the God of loving-kindness, Jehovah also loy-

ally supports his faithful servants. In these last days
of Satan’s world, we have reason to trust that Jehovah will sustain and protect all who seek his Kingdom ?rst. Bear in mind that during the last days of
Jerusalem, Jeremiah depended on Jehovah for food
and protection. God never let the prophet down.
(Jer. 15:15; read Lamentations 3:55-57.) If you ?nd
yourself under great pressure of any kind, be assured
that Jehovah remembers your acts of loyalty. Because of his loving-kindness, he desires to support
you so that you will not ‘come to your ?nish.’—Lam.
3:22.

“AS JEHOVAH IS ALIVE . . . IN JUSTICE!”
14

Some people spend years in prison for crimes

they did not commit. There have even been cases in
which a court condemned a man to death and only
after the execution did evidence of his innocence
come to light. Parents in some countries are so desperate for food that they sell their children as slaves
so that the family can get something to eat. How do
you feel when you hear of such injustice today? How
do you think Jehovah feels? The Bible makes it clear
that he wants to remove all causes of su?ering. He
is the only One capable of doing so. Hence, the poor
and innocent who su?er today can take heart. Jehovah, the God of justice, is taking steps to save them
from their present distress.—Jer. 23:5, 6.
15

In Jeremiah’s time, some were aware of God’s

superior quality of justice. For example, the prophet raised the possibility that Israel might repent of
their sins and make a statement, as it were, attesting

to this change of heart, saying: “As Jehovah is alive
in truth, in justice and in righteousness!” (Jer. 4:1, 2)
That is true because injustice has no place in Jehovah’s purpose. But there are other proofs that Jehovah is a lover of justice.
16

God unquestionably keeps his word and is un-

hypocritical. While many humans break promises
they make to others, Jehovah does not. Even the laws
of nature, which he has established and from which
we bene?t, are unbreakable. (Jer. 31:35, 36) We can
also depend on his promises and his judicial decisions, for they are always good.—Read Lamentations
3:37, 38.
17

When judging, Jehovah is never satis?ed with the

mere outward appearance of a matter. He looks beyond the obvious to get all the facts. He also assesses the motives of those involved. Doctors can now
use specialized equipment and techniques to look at
a patient’s heart while it is pumping, thus gaining in17. (a) What does Jehovah do when judging matters? (b) Why can you

194

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

THEY JUDGE FOR JEHOVAH
Through his written Word and the Christian congregation, Jehovah has trained elders in his methods of judging. He has authorized them to represent him in handling problems in the congregation.
Such brothers are imperfect, and they cannot read
the heart, as Jehovah does. But they want to treat
their fellow worshippers in accord with the example Almighty God sets. They pray for divine guidance and strive to apply relevant Bible principles,
thus seeking to ‘judge with righteousness,’ as Jehovah himself does. (Jer. 11:20) Thus, you have good
reason to trust the elders, “for they are keeping
watch over your souls as those who will render an
account.”—Heb. 13:17.
formation about its condition. Or they can examine
the kidneys, which are doing the work of ?ltering
blood. Jehovah can do much more. He examines the
?gurative heart and assesses a person’s motives and
the ?gurative kidneys, which re?ect a person’s deepest feelings. He can thus verify what moved a person
to act in a certain way and how he feels about his actions. And the Almighty is not overwhelmed by the
“Was Not That a Case of Knowing Me?”

195

abundance of details that his close examination reveals. Better than the most insightful human judge,
He uses all that information correctly and in a balanced way to determine our future.—Read Jeremiah
12:1a; 20:12.
18

You thus have a solid basis for trusting in Jeho-

vah, even if at times you feel some pangs of conscience because of past mistakes. Never forget that
Jehovah is not a tenacious prosecutor who looks for
a reason to punish, but rather, he is a compassionate Judge who wants to help. If you have unsettled
feelings over your past course or an issue involving
some other person, ask Jehovah to take up “the contests,” or emotional struggles, so that you can put
the matter behind you.1 With his help, you can see
the high value God places on your continued share
in sacred service.—Read Lamentations 3:58, 59.
19

Understandably, the God of perfect justice de-

sires that those seeking his approval practice justice themselves. (Jer. 7:5-7; 22:3) Preaching the good
news without prejudice is an important way of displaying divine justice. When you are conscientious in
making return visits and conducting Bible studies,
you re?ect God’s superior standard of justice in a
truly bene?cial way. How is that? He desires that all
sorts of people learn about him and attain salvation.
(Lam. 3:25, 26) What a privilege you have to be
God’s fellow worker, re?ecting his justice in that lifesaving work!
How does Jehovah’s justice bring you comfort? How can
you comfort others by imitating God’s justice?

Jehovah made to his people, as recorded in these

books. He urged the Jews: “Turn back, please, each
one from his bad way, and make your ways and
your dealings good.” Another time, Jeremiah exhorted them: “Make your ways and your dealings good,
and obey the voice of Jehovah your God, and Jehovah will feel regret for the calamity that he has spoken against you.” (Jer. 18:11; 26:13) In our day, Jehovah continues to forgive all who are sincerely
remorseful and stop wrong practices.
21

Yet, Jehovah goes beyond speaking about for-

giveness. He acts accordingly. Jehovah used Jeremiah to exhort: “Do return, O renegade Israel . . . I
shall not have my face drop angrily upon you people . . . I shall not stay resentful to time indefinite.” (Jer. 3:12) God does not feel lingering anger or bitterness toward any of his people whom
he has forgiven. Rather, though a wrong has been
committed, Jehovah wants to repair the damaged
relationship. Despite the sins a person may have
committed, if that sinner truly repents and seeks
God’s forgiveness, Jehovah will ‘bring him back’ to
21. What does Jehovah want to accomplish when he forgives a person?
198

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

HOW DOES JEHOVAH
“FEEL REGRET”?
The greatness of God’s forgiveness comes into focus in his treatment of those who practiced sin but
who later have a change of heart. When he observes
that they turn their lives around and obey him, he
comes to “feel regret.” (Jer. 18:8; 26:3) In what way?
God is perfect and never errs in judgment, so it is
not that he feels regret in the way that a human does
when he has completely misjudged a matter. Rather, Jehovah feels regret by adjusting his dealings, responding to the change of heart he observes.
This is not just a cold rescinding of a sentence. Jehovah’s feelings change toward repentant sinners.
According to some scholars, the origin of the Hebrew verb translated “feel regret” in the verses cited above is thought to re?ect the idea of “breathing deeply,” maybe with a sigh. This may indicate
that when Jehovah sees genuine remorse in a human
heart, ?guratively he breathes deeply, as with a sigh
of relief. God can show the repentant person the
loving attention enjoyed by those having His approval. That sinner may still face certain consequences,
yet God is pleased with his change of heart. He softens “the calamity,” or divine discipline, that otherwise might be due. (Jer. 26:13) What human judge
is inclined to recognize true repentance in this way?
Jehovah takes delight in doing so.—Jer. 9:24.
“Was Not That a Case of Knowing Me?”

His favor and blessing. (Jer. 15:19) That reassurance
should encourage anyone now estranged from the
true God to return to him. Do you not agree that Jehovah’s forgiveness attracts us to him?—Read Lamentations 5:21.
22

When someone o?ends you by thoughtless

words and actions, will you imitate Jehovah? Regarding the ancient Jews, God said that he would
“purify” those whom he forgave. (Read Jeremiah
33:8.) He is able to purify, or cleanse, in the sense
of putting behind him the error of repentant ones,
giving the person a new start in His service. Granted, gaining God’s forgiveness does not mean that
the person is puri?ed of inherited imperfection so
that he is now perfect, sinless. Still, there is a lesson for us in what God said about purifying humans. We can strive to put behind us the error,
or o?ense, of the other person, which ?guratively
amounts to purifying the view of that person that
we have in our heart. How so?
22, 23. As you imitate Jehovah in the matter of forgiveness, what should
be your goal?

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

Imagine that you received an heirloom bowl or

vase as a gift. If it became soiled or stained, would
your immediate response be to throw it away? Not
likely. You would probably put forth e?ort to clean
it carefully, removing any spots or dirt and perhaps
eliminating the stain. You want to behold its beauty, the way it gleams in the sunlight. In like fashion, you can work hard to get rid of any lingering
rancor or feelings of annoyance toward a brother
or a sister who o?ended you. Fight the tendency to
dwell on the painful words or acts. As you succeed
in putting them behind you, you purify the image
and memories you have in your heart of the one
whom you have forgiven. With your heart cleansed
of negative thoughts toward that one, you are more
open to enjoy again the close friendship that had
seemed lost for good.

bene?ts of knowing Jehovah intimately are a strong
motivation to worship him acceptably. If we get to
know Jehovah as intimately as King Josiah did, our
life will be brimming with happiness, which is another aspect of God’s personality.
25

Knowing Jehovah to a greater extent will en-

rich our relationships with others. By our working
to show loving-kindness, justice, and forgiveness
as Jehovah does, our friendships in the Christian
congregation will deepen and become more precious. Moreover, we will ?nd ourselves more capable of teaching as we make return visits in our
territory and conduct progressive Bible studies. Interested ones will feel more comfortable with the
pattern of Christian living that they see in us.
Hence, we will be better equipped to help them
worship Jehovah acceptably, to follow “the good
way.”—Jer. 6:16.

“J EHOVAH H AS D ONE W HAT

JERUSALEM lay in ruins. Smoke still rose from the
?res the conquering Babylonians had lit. Jeremiah
could recall the ghastly shrieks of those being slain.
He had been told what was to happen, and events unfolded exactly as God had said. “Jehovah has done
what he had in mind,” sighed the prophet. What a
tragedy Jerusalem’s downfall had been!—Read Lamentations 2:17.
2

Yes, Jeremiah saw the ful?llment of many proph-

ecies conveyed to God’s people, including ancient
prophecies. Centuries earlier, Moses set before Israel the consequences of obeying or disobeying God
—either “the blessing” or “the malediction.” Jehovah wanted the best for his people, the blessings.
The maledictions resulting from disobedience, on

the other hand, would be horrendous. Moses warned
—and Jeremiah later repeated—that those ignoring
and opposing Jehovah would even “eat the ?esh of
their sons and the ?esh of their daughters.” (Deut.
30:19, 20; Jer. 19:9; Lev. 26:29) ‘Could such an awful
thing actually happen?’ some may have wondered.
Well, during the Babylonian siege, when food was
not to be found, that did occur. “The very hands of
compassionate women have boiled their own children,” Jeremiah reported. “They have become as
bread of consolation to one during the breakdown of
the daughter of my people.” (Lam. 4:10) What a tragedy!
3

Of course, Jehovah’s purpose in commissioning

prophets like Jeremiah was not simply to announce
impending doom. God wanted his people to return
to a course of faithfulness. He wanted sinners to repent. Ezra pointed this out: “Jehovah the God of
their forefathers kept sending against them by means
of his messengers, sending again and again, because

he felt compassion for his people and for his dwelling.”—2 Chron. 36:15; read Jeremiah 26:3, 12, 13.
4

Like Jehovah, Jeremiah felt compassion for his

people. You can see that from what he said before
Jerusalem’s fall. He was deeply perturbed by that
looming disaster. This was a catastrophe that could
be averted if only the people would listen to and
obey the message Jeremiah bore! Try to imagine Jeremiah’s emotions as he delivered God’s message.
“O my intestines, my intestines!” he cried. “I am in
severe pains in the walls of my heart. My heart is
boisterous within me. I cannot keep silent, for the
sound of the horn is what my soul has heard, the
alarm signal of war.” (Jer. 4:19) He simply could not
keep quiet about the approaching calamity.
HOW COULD HE BE S O SURE?
5

Why could Jeremiah be con?dent that what he

prophesied would occur? (Jer. 1:17; 7:30; 9:22) He

prophecy. History testi?ed to Jehovah’s ability to
foretell events that seemed impossible from a human
standpoint, such as the liberation of Israel from
bondage in Egypt. Jeremiah was familiar with the
Exodus account and with the words of one eyewitness. Joshua had reminded fellow Israelites: “You
well know with all your hearts and with all your
souls that not one word out of all the good words
that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed.
They have all come true for you. Not one word of
them has failed.”—Josh. 23:14.

Why should you continue to give attention to the

prophecies Jeremiah presented? First, because he
had justi?able con?dence in the reliability of Jehovah’s words. Second, because some of God’s pronouncements through Jeremiah are now being ful?lled, and you will yet see the ful?llment of others.
Third, because the sheer number of announcements
that Jeremiah made in God’s name, as well as the
vigor with which he made them, marked him as an

extraordinary servant of God. “Even in the company of the prophets, Jeremiah towers as a giant,”
notes one scholar. Jeremiah was recognized as such
a powerful ?gure in God’s dealings with His people
that when Jesus was speaking, some who heard him
believed that he must be Jeremiah.—Matt. 16:13, 14.

Like Jeremiah, you live at a time when crucial Bi-

ble prophecies are being ful?lled. And like Jeremiah,
you need to maintain con?dence in the truthfulness
of God’s promises. (2 Pet. 3:9-14) How can you do
that? By continuing to build your trust in the absolute reliability of God’s prophetic Word. To that end,
in this chapter we will review a number of prophecies that Jeremiah transmitted and that he saw ful?lled. Others that we will consider were ful?lled later. And still others directly a?ect you now and will
a?ect your future. Let this review strengthen your
trust in Jehovah’s prophetic Word so that you become even more convinced that ‘he will do what he
has in mind.’—Lam. 2:17.

PROPHECIES JEREMIAH STATED
AND SAW FULFILLED
8

There are many who try to predict the future.

Think of economists, politicians, spiritists, and
weather forecasters. No doubt, you have seen the
di?culty of making even simple predictions—what
might happen in a few days or weeks—with any accuracy. But accurate prophecy is one of the Bible’s
hallmarks. (Isa. 41:26; 42:9) All of Jeremiah’s prophecies, whether dealing with the near or the distant
future, were unerring. Many of them concerned individuals and nations. Let us ?rst consider a few that
were ful?lled during Jeremiah’s lifetime.
9

Who today can predict what the world scene will

be in a year or two? For example, what analyst of
international a?airs can accurately foretell whether there will be some realignment of governmental
powers? By divine inspiration, however, Jeremiah
foretold the expansion of Babylon’s sphere of in?uence. Babylon, he stated, was the “golden cup”
by which Jehovah would pour out his indignation

208

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

against Judah and against many nearby cities and
peoples, forcing them into servitude. (Jer. 51:7) That
is exactly what Jeremiah and his contemporaries witnessed.—Compare Jeremiah 25:15-29; 27:3-6; 46:13.
10

Jehovah also used Jeremiah to indicate the fate

of four Judean kings. Regarding Jehoahaz, or Shallum, a son of King Josiah, God foretold that he
would be exiled and would never return to Judah.
(Jer. 22:11, 12) That happened. (2 Ki. 23:31-34) God
proclaimed that Jehoahaz’s successor, Jehoiakim,
would be buried “with the burial of a he-ass.” (Jer.
22:18, 19; 36:30) The Bible does not specify how he
died or what was done with his corpse, but it does
show that his son Jehoiachin succeeded him during
the siege. Jeremiah predicted that Jehoiachin (also
known as Coniah and Jeconiah) would be exiled to
Babylon and would die there. (Jer. 22:24-27; 24:1)
That came to pass. What of the last king, Zedekiah?
Jeremiah foretold that Zedekiah would be given into
the hands of enemies, who would show no compassion. (Jer. 21:1-10) What occurred? Those enemies

did capture him. They slaughtered his young sons before his eyes, blinded him, and took him to Babylon,
where he died. (Jer. 52:8-11) Yes, all these prophecies came true.
11

We read in Jeremiah chapter 28 that during Zed-

ekiah’s reign, the false prophet Hananiah contradicted Jehovah’s pronouncement through Jeremiah
about Babylonian dominion over Jerusalem. Ignoring God’s word, Hananiah claimed that the yoke bar
of slavery that Nebuchadnezzar imposed upon Judah and other nations would be broken. However,
under Jehovah’s direction, Jeremiah exposed Hananiah’s falsehood, reiterated that many nations would
have to serve the Babylonians, and told the false
prophet that he would be dead within the year. And
thus it proved to be.—Read Jeremiah 28:10-17.
12

Of course, the central prophetic message that

God gave to Jeremiah concerned the downfall of Jerusalem itself. Time and again, Jeremiah warned that
the city would be overthrown unless the Jews repent11. Who was Hananiah, and what did Jehovah foretell about him?
12. How did most of Jeremiah’s contemporaries react to his main prophetic message?
210

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

ed of their idolatry, injustice, and violence. (Jer. 4:1;
16:18; 19:3-5, 15) Many of Jeremiah’s contemporaries
thought that Jehovah would never do such a thing.
God’s temple stood in Jerusalem. How could he allow that holy place to be destroyed? It would never
happen, they thought. Yet, you know that Jehovah
does not lie. He did what he had in mind.—Jer.
52:12-14.
13

God’s people today ?nd themselves in a situa-

tion comparable to that of those loyal to Jehovah in
Jeremiah’s day. We know that Jehovah will soon
bring calamity on all who refuse to heed his warnings. Still, we can take heart from his prophetic
promises, as did those Jews who held to pure worship in Jeremiah’s time. Because of the Rechabites’
faithfulness to Jehovah and to the commands of
their forefather, God said that they would survive Jerusalem’s fall. They did. The later mention of “Malchijah the son of Rechab,” who helped repair Jerusalem during Nehemiah’s governorship, may give

211

evidence of that. (Neh. 3:14; Jer. 35:18, 19) Jehovah assured Ebed-melech that he too would survive
because he trusted in God and supported Jeremiah. (Jer. 38:11-13; 39:15-18) Likewise, God promised
that Jeremiah’s companion Baruch would receive his
“soul as a spoil.” (Jer. 45:1, 5) What conclusion do
you reach from the outworking of these prophecies?
How do you think Jehovah will deal with you if you
are faithful?—Read 2 Peter 2:9.

about such prophecies?
PROPHECIES FULFILLED LATER
14

God foretold that Nebuchadnezzar would con-

quer not only Judah but also Egypt. (Jer. 25:17-19)
That must have seemed most unlikely because Egypt
was so powerful, even dominating Judah. (2 Ki.
23:29-35) After Jerusalem’s fall, a remnant of Jews
planned to leave their land to ?nd safety and security in Egypt. They wanted to do that despite Jehovah’s having warned them not to and his saying that
14. Why was God’s prophecy about Babylon outstanding?
212

he would bless them if they remained in Judah. If,
on the other hand, they ?ed to Egypt, the sword that
they feared would catch up with them there. (Jer.
42:10-16; 44:30) Whether Jeremiah saw the Babylonian invasion of Egypt is not stated in his writings.
What is certain is that the ful?llment of Jehovah’s
prophecies overtook the Israelite refugees when the
Babylonians conquered Egypt early in the sixth century B.C.E.—Jer. 43:8-13.
15

Jeremiah also prophesied about the end of

Egypt’s conqueror, Babylon itself. A century before
it occurred, Jeremiah accurately predicted the sudden fall of Babylon. How? God’s prophet foretold
that her protective waters would be “dried up,” and
her mighty men would not ?ght. (Jer. 50:38; 51:30)
These prophecies were ful?lled in detail when the
Medes and the Persians diverted the Euphrates River, waded across its bed, and then entered the city,
taking the Babylonians by surprise. You would likely consider equally signi?cant the declaration that
15, 16. How was God’s word regarding the liberation of his people realized?
“Jehovah Has Done What He Had in Mind”

213

the city would become an uninhabited wasteland.
(Jer. 50:39; 51:26) To this day, the desolate condition
of once-mighty Babylon testi?es to the accuracy of
divine prophecy.
16

Jehovah proclaimed through Jeremiah that the

Jews would serve the Babylonians for 70 years. Then
God would bring his people back to their land. (Read
Jeremiah 25:8-11; 29:10.) Daniel had full con?dence in
this prophecy, and he used it to determine when “the
devastations of Jerusalem” would end. (Dan. 9:2)
“That Jehovah’s word from the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished,” stated Ezra, “Jehovah
roused the spirit of Cyrus the king of Persia,” who
had conquered Babylon, to restore the Jews to their
land. (Ezra 1:1-4) The returnees could thereafter exult in the peace of their homeland and restore pure
worship there, as Jeremiah had foretold.—Jer. 30:810; 31:3, 11, 12; 32:37.
17

Jeremiah also recorded prophecies that ?nd ful-

?llment far in the future. He stated: “This is what
17. Explain how Jeremiah’s words about “weeping” at Ramah may refer
to two distinct occasions.
214

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

Jehovah has said, ‘In Ramah a voice is being heard,
lamentation and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping over
her sons. She has refused to be comforted over her
sons, because they are no more.’ ” (Jer. 31:15) It appears that captive Jews assembled in the city of Ramah, some ?ve miles north of Jerusalem, after its
devastation in 607 B.C.E. Some prisoners may even
have been executed at Ramah. That may have occasioned an initial ful?llment, as if it were Rachel
weeping over the loss of her “sons.” More than
six centuries later, though, King Herod had infants
of Bethlehem slaughtered. Gospel writer Matthew
explained that Jeremiah’s words foretold the bitter
reaction to that massacre.—Matt. 2:16-18.
18

Another prophecy was also ful?lled in the ?rst

century C.E. God foretold through Jeremiah that
Edom was among the nations that would su?er
from the Babylonian invasion. (Jer. 25:15-17, 21; 27:
1-7) But the divine word went beyond that. Edom
would become like Sodom and Gomorrah. You know
what that meant—uninhabited for all time, ceasing
18. How was God’s prophecy concerning Edom ful?lled?
“Jehovah Has Done What He Had in Mind”

215

to exist. (Jer. 49:7-10, 17, 18) That is exactly what
happened. Where do you think the names Edom and
Edomites can be found today? On any modern maps?
No. They are mainly found in books of ancient and
Bible history or on maps re?ecting that time. Flavius
Josephus recounts that the Edomites were forced to
accept Judaism in the second century B.C.E. Thereafter, with the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 C.E.,
they ceased to exist as a distinct people.
19

As you can see, chapter after chapter of the book

of Jeremiah is packed with prophecies concerning
individuals and nations. The majority of these
prophecies have already been ful?lled. This reality alone makes the book worth your attention and
study because it con?rms for you something about
your great God. Jehovah has done what he had in
mind, and he will yet do so. (Read Isaiah 46:9-11.)
This can strengthen your con?dence in what the Bible foretells. In fact, some prophecies Jeremiah recorded have ful?llments that directly a?ect you and
19. What does the book of Jeremiah reveal as to God’s ability to ful?ll

your future. Let us examine some of these in the remaining section of this chapter.
What are some prophecies that were ful?lled after
Jeremiah’s death, and why are these important to you?
PROPHECIES THAT AFFECT YOU
20

A Bible prophecy may have more than one ful-

?llment. That is true of the answer Jesus gave to
his disciples’ question about the sign of his “presence and of the conclusion of the system of things.”
(Matt. 24:3) There was a ful?llment in the years 66
to 70 C.E. It is evident, however, that in certain respects that prophecy will yet be ful?lled during the
“great tribulation” to come on this entire wicked system. That will be a tribulation “such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor
will occur again.” (Matt. 24:21) Similar parallels exist in the prophecies recorded by Jeremiah. Some
of these had an initial ful?llment that occurred in
607 B.C.E. but a secondary ful?llment that would

book of Jeremiah, have more than one ful?llment? Illustrate.
“Jehovah Has Done What He Had in Mind”

217

occur much later, as we noted in connection with
“Rachel weeping over her sons.” (Jer. 31:15) Indeed,
some of what Jeremiah foretold refers to the time in
which you live, and the ful?llment a?ects you personally.
21

You can see that from the book of Revelation.

Under inspiration, the apostle John referred back to
prophecies that Jeremiah had given concerning the
end of Babylon in 539 B.C.E. We ?nd in Revelation
parallels between that earlier event and what is destined to occur on a larger scale. Among the prophecies spoken by Jeremiah and ful?lled in modern
times was one about the fall of a great empire—the
world empire of false religion, “Babylon the Great.”
(Rev. 14:8; 17:1, 2, 5; Jer. 50:2; 51:8) God’s people
would have to “get out of her” so as not to share her
fate. (Rev. 18:2, 4; Jer. 51:6) The waters of that city,
symbolizing her peoples, or adherents, would “dry
up.”—Jer. 51:36; Rev. 16:12.
22

Still to be ful?lled in our future is the promise

that God will execute vengeance on false religion for
218

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

her ill-treatment of his people. Jehovah will “pay
back to her according to . . . all that she has done.”
(Jer. 50:29; 51:9; Rev. 18:6) And the ?gurative lands
of false religion must become a desolate waste.—Jer.
50:39, 40.
23

As you may have already noted, the prophecies

that Jeremiah presented also have an optimistic tone.
Accordingly, he foretold a restoration of true worship on earth in modern times. The release of Jewish captives from the ancient city of Babylon found
a parallel in the release of God’s modern-day people
from Babylon the Great after the Kingdom was established in heaven. In a spiritual sense, Jehovah restored his people to pure worship, their state being marked by thanksgiving and rejoicing. He has
blessed their e?orts to help others come to worship
him and to be richly fed spiritually. (Read Jeremiah
30:18, 19.) You also know from personal experience
how in modern times Jehovah has ful?lled his promise to provide his people with shepherds—spiritually

219

mature men who really care for and protect the
?ock.—Jer. 3:15; 23:3, 4.
24

Jeremiah’s words to God’s ancient people bal-

anced a promise of better things for the faithful with
a warning of destruction for those not holding to
their relationship with Jehovah. It is similar today.
We can hardly fail to see the urgency of the warning implicit in these words: “Those slain by Jehovah
will certainly come to be in that day from one end
of the earth clear to the other end of the earth. They
will not be bewailed, neither will they be gathered
up or be buried. As manure on the surface of the
ground they will become.”—Jer. 25:33.
25

Yes, like Jeremiah, we live in critical times. As

in his day, people’s reaction to Jehovah’s message
can mean life or death. God’s people today are not
prophets. We are not inspired to add to Jehovah’s infallible words of truth found in the Bible. Still, we
have been commissioned to preach the good news of
the Kingdom all the days until the end of the system

220

of things. (Matt. 28:19, 20) We certainly do not want
to ‘steal away Jehovah’s words’ by concealing from
people what is about to happen. (Read Jeremiah 23:
30.) We are determined not to take away from his
words their force and e?ect. Many prophecies that
God had Jeremiah proclaim have already been ful?lled. This assures us that those remaining to be ful?lled are absolutely trustworthy. We must tell people that God will unfailingly do ‘what he has in mind
and what he commanded from the days of long ago.’
—Lam. 2:17.
26

No consideration of Jeremiah’s prophetic activi-

ty and message would be complete without giving attention to Jehovah’s grand promises of “a new covenant” with his people, the laws of which he would
write in their heart. (Jer. 31:31-33) This prophecy
and its ful?llment, which have a direct bearing on
you, are the subject of the following chapter.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN

YOU CAN B ENEFIT F ROM
THE N EW C OVENANT
JEHOVAH gave Jeremiah a twofold commission. One
part was “to uproot and to pull down and to destroy
and to tear down.” The other was “to build and to
plant.” The prophet accomplished the former by exposing the wickedness of the proud Jews, pronouncing God’s judgment on them as well as on Babylon.
Yet, Jeremiah’s prophecies included hope for the future. He foretold the building of what God purposed
to be built and the planting of what He purposed to
be planted. For example, Jeremiah was ful?lling the
second part of his assignment when he directed attention to the restoration of the Jews to their homeland.—Jer. 1:10; 30:17, 18.
2

That Jeremiah proclaimed restoration did not

mean that God would beforehand pamper his people
or compromise his standard of justice. No, he would
1. What twofold commission did Jeremiah ful?ll?
2. Why did Jehovah execute judgment on his people, and to what extent?
222

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

execute judgment on the wayward Jews. (Read Jeremiah 16:17, 18.) In Jeremiah’s day, few in Jerusalem were
“doing justice” or “seeking faithfulness,” and Jehovah’s patience had reached its limit. He said: “I have
got tired of feeling regret.” (Jer. 5:1; 15:6, 7) Those
Jews had “returned to the errors of their forefathers,
the ?rst ones, who refused to obey” Jehovah’s words.
Moreover, they angered God by their adulterous relationship with false gods. (Jer. 11:10; 34:18) Jehovah
would correct his people, even chastise them, “to the
proper degree.” As a result, some individuals might
come to their senses and return to him.—Jer. 30:11;
46:28.
3

God used Jeremiah to foretell something that

would have much broader and long-term bene?ts—a
new covenant. In considering Jeremiah’s prophetic
writings, we have ample reason to focus on this bright
aspect: the new covenant. It was to replace the covenant that had been made with Israel after the Exodus, with Moses as its mediator. (Read Jeremiah 31:31,
32.) When instituting the Lord’s Evening Meal, Jesus
3. Why should you consider the prophecy about the new covenant?

223

Christ spoke of this new covenant, so it is de?nitely
of interest to us. (Luke 22:20) The apostle Paul referred to this covenant when writing to the Hebrews.
He quoted Jeremiah’s prophecy and stressed the importance of the new covenant. (Heb. 8:7-9) But what
exactly is the new covenant? Why did it become necessary? Who are involved, and how can you personally bene?t? Let us see.
WHY THE NEW COVENANT?
4

To understand the new covenant, we ?rst have to

grasp the purpose of the former one, the Law covenant. It was to accomplish a number of excellent objectives for the nation that was awaiting a promised
Seed, who would be a means to bless many. (Gen. 22:
17, 18) When the Israelites accepted the Law covenant, they became God’s “special property.” Under
that covenant, the tribe of Levi would provide priests
for the nation. When making that national covenant
between himself and Israel at Mount Sinai, Jehovah
mentioned “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation”
4. What did the Law covenant accomplish?
224

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

but left open when and by what means that would
come about. (Ex. 19:5-8) Until it did, that covenant
made it clear that the Israelites could not keep the
Law in all respects. So it made their sins manifest.
Hence, under the Law, the Israelites were to o?er sacri?ces regularly to cover their sins. Yet, there clearly
was a need for something more, a perfect sacri?ce
that would not have to be repeated. Yes, there was a
dire need for lasting forgiveness of sin.—Gal. 3:19-22.
5

We can thus begin to see why, even while the Law

covenant was still in force, God had Jeremiah point
forward to another covenant, the new covenant. Out
of his love and kindness, Jehovah wanted to make
permanent help available to more than one nation.
Through Jeremiah, God said regarding those in this
future covenant: “I shall forgive their error, and their
sin I shall remember no more.” (Jer. 31:34) Though
that promise was given in Jeremiah’s day, it holds out
a wonderful prospect for all mankind. How?

225

this reality. That was illustrated by a brother who was
?ghting against a signi?cant personal problem. He
comments: “When I relapsed, I felt terrible. I thought
that I could never atone for what I had done. I found
it hard to pray. I would start by saying, ‘Jehovah, I
don’t know whether you are going to hear this prayer,
but . . .’ ” Some who have had such a relapse or have
committed a sin have felt as if “a cloud mass” were
blocking their prayers from reaching God. (Lam. 3:
44) Others have been haunted by memories of past
wrongdoing, years after the incident. Even otherwise
exemplary Christians may say things that they later
regret.—Jas. 3:5-10.
7

None of us should feel that we could never stray

into inappropriate conduct. (1 Cor. 10:12) Even the
apostle Paul realized that he erred. (Read Romans 7:
21-25.) In this connection, the new covenant should
come to mind. God promised that one key aspect of
the new covenant would be his remembering sins no
more. What an incomparable bene?t! Foretelling that
must have truly moved Jeremiah, and we can similar226

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

ly be moved as we learn more about the new covenant and see how we can bene?t from it.
Why did God conclude a new covenant?
WHAT IS THE NEW COVENANT?
8

As you come to know Jehovah better, you increas-

ingly realize how kind and merciful he is to imperfect humans. (Ps. 103:13, 14) In foretelling the new
covenant, Jeremiah highlighted that Jehovah would
“forgive their error” and remember sin no more. (Jer.
31:34) You can imagine that Jeremiah might have
wondered how God would accomplish that forgiveness. At least he could understand that in speaking of
a new covenant, God meant that there would be an
agreement, or contract, between Him and humans.
Somehow, by means of that covenant, Jehovah would
accomplish what he inspired Jeremiah to outline,
including forgiveness. More details would have to
await God’s further revealing of his purpose, including what the Messiah would do.
9

You may have seen parents who spoil their

8, 9. What did it cost Jehovah to make forgiveness of sin possible?

227

children, not disciplining them. Would you expect Jehovah to be like that? Not at all! This is clear from
the way the new covenant took e?ect. Instead of just
canceling sins, God scrupulously met his own standard of justice by providing the legal basis for forgiving sins, doing so at great cost to himself. You can
gain insight into this by noting what Paul wrote when
discussing the new covenant. (Read Hebrews 9:15, 22,
28.) Paul mentioned “release by ransom” and said
that “unless blood is poured out no forgiveness takes
place.” In the case of the new covenant, this did not
mean the sacri?cial blood of bulls or goats as o?ered
under the Law. No, the new covenant was made operative by Jesus’ blood. Based on that perfect sacri?ce, Jehovah could ‘forgive error and sin’ lastingly.
(Acts 2:38; 3:19) But who would be in this new covenant and gain that forgiveness? Not the Jewish nation. Jesus said that God would reject the Jews, those
who o?ered animal sacri?ces under the Law, and He
would turn to another nation. (Matt. 21:43; Acts 3:1315) That proved to be “the Israel of God,” composed of Christians anointed with holy spirit. In ba228

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

sic terms, the Law covenant was between God and
natural Israel, while the new covenant is between Jehovah God and spiritual Israel, with Jesus as its Mediator.—Gal. 6:16; Rom. 9:6.
10

Jeremiah depicted the coming One, the Messi-

ah, as the “sprout” for David. That is ?tting. Even
while Jeremiah was serving as a prophet, David’s royal family tree was cut down. However, the stump was
not dead. In time, Jesus was born in the line of
King David. He could be called “Jehovah Is Our
Righteousness,” highlighting God’s deep concern for
that quality. (Read Jeremiah 23:5, 6.) Jehovah allowed
his only-begotten Son to experience su?ering on
earth and to die. Then Jehovah—in harmony with
justice—could apply the value of the ransom sacri?ce
of the “sprout” for David as a basis for forgiveness.
(Jer. 33:15) This opened the way for some humans to
be declared “righteous for life” and anointed with
holy spirit, becoming parties to the new covenant. As
further evidence of God’s concern for righteousness,

others who are not directly in that covenant can and
do bene?t from it, as we will see.—Rom. 5:18.
11

Would you like to know other distinctive aspects

of the new covenant? One major di?erence between
it and the Mosaic Law covenant is what they were
written on. (Read Jeremiah 31:33.) The Ten Commandments of the Law covenant were written on
stone tablets, which eventually disappeared. In contrast, Jeremiah prophesied that the law of the new
covenant would be written in human hearts, and it
would endure. Those who are parties to the new covenant, anointed Christians, truly appreciate this law.
What of those who are not directly in the new covenant, the “other sheep,” who hope to live forever on
earth? (John 10:16) These too delight in God’s law. In
a sense, they are like the alien residents in Israel,
who accepted and bene?ted from the Mosaic Law.
—Lev. 24:22; Num. 15:15.

that is inscribed in the heart of anointed Christians?’
Well, this law is also called “the law of the Christ.” It
was ?rst given to spiritual Israelites, those in the new
covenant. (Gal. 6:2; Rom. 2:28, 29) You could sum up
“the law of the Christ” in one word: love. (Matt. 22:3639) How do those of the anointed get this law written in their heart? Key ways are by their studying
God’s Word and approaching Jehovah in prayer. Accordingly, those aspects of true worship should be
regular features of the lives of all true Christians,
even those who are not in the new covenant but who
want to bene?t from it.
13

“The law of the Christ” is referred to as “the per-

fect law that belongs to freedom” and “the law of a
free people.” (Jas. 1:25; 2:12) Many were born under
the Mosaic Law, but no one is born into the new covenant or under the law of the Christ. None who become obedient to the law of the Christ are coerced
into serving God. Rather, they are delighted to know
that God’s law can be written in hearts and that

How did God make forgiveness possible through
the new covenant? How can you learn about the law
that is written in hearts?
BENEFICIARIES OF THE NEW COVENANT
14

Upon learning that the 144,000 are in the new

covenant, some may have thought that only these
bene?t from it. Perhaps they thought so because only
anointed ones are to partake of the emblems at the
annual Memorial of Christ’s death, where the wine
represents the “blood of the covenant.” (Mark 14:24)
Recall, though, that those in the new covenant are to
be associates with Jesus as the “seed” of Abraham, by
means of which all nations will be blessed. (Gal. 3:8,
9, 29; Gen. 12:3) Somehow, through the new covenant,
Jehovah will ful?ll his promise to bless all mankind
through Abraham’s “seed.”
15

Jesus Christ, the primary part of the seed of

Abraham, serves as High Priest, and he provided the
perfect sacri?ce that makes possible forgiveness of

error and sin. (Read Hebrews 2:17, 18.) Yet, God long
ago pointed forward to “a kingdom of priests and a
holy nation.” (Ex. 19:6) In natural Israel the priests
were from one tribe, and the kings were from a different tribe. So how would this promised nation of
king-priests come about? The apostle Peter directed
his ?rst letter to ones who were sancti?ed by the spirit. (1 Pet. 1:1, 2) He referred to such ones as “a royal
priesthood, a holy nation, a people for special possession.” (1 Pet. 2:9) Anointed Christians in the new covenant will thus serve as underpriests. Think of what
that means! We daily struggle under the in?uence of
sin, which still ‘rules as king.’ Those serving as underpriests will have had a similar experience. (Rom.
5:21) They will be aware of how it feels to make mistakes and grapple with guilt. So along with Christ,
they will be able to sympathize with us as we overcome sinful tendencies.
16

At Revelation 7:9, 14, the “great crowd” are seen

“dressed in white robes,” which implies a clean standing with God. To be in line to survive “the great

tribulation,” that great crowd is now being formed.
Hence, even now these gain a certain righteous standing before God. They are being declared righteous as
Jehovah’s friends. (Rom. 4:2, 3; Jas. 2:23) What a bene?t that is! If you are part of the great crowd, you can
be sure that God is willing to work with you as you
strive to remain clean in his eyes.
17

What happens to the sins of those whom God fa-

vors? As noted earlier, Jehovah said through Jeremiah: “I shall forgive their error, and their sin I shall remember no more.” (Jer. 31:34) God does this for the
anointed on the basis of Jesus’ sacri?ce. In a similar
way, God can forgive the sins of the great crowd on
the basis of the same “blood of the covenant.” Jeremiah’s saying that God would “remember” sins no
more does not imply that He would have a memory
lapse and simply not be able to recall the sins. Rather, it indicates that once Jehovah has administered
any needed discipline and forgiven a repentant sinner, God throws that past sin behind Him. Think of
the sins King David committed involving Bath-sheba
17. In what sense does Jehovah “remember” sins no more?
234

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

and Uriah. David received discipline and felt the consequences of his sins. (2 Sam. 11:4, 15, 27; 12:9-14; Isa.
38:17) Yet, God did not keep holding David accountable for those sins. (Read 2 Chronicles 7:17, 18.) As indicated in the new covenant, once Jehovah has forgiven sins, based on Jesus’ sacri?ce, He remembers
them no more.—Ezek. 18:21, 22.
18

Accordingly, the new covenant highlights a won-

derful aspect of Jehovah’s dealings with sinful humans, both the anointed, who are in the covenant,
and those with an earthly hope. You can trust that
once Jehovah has dealt with your sins, he will not
bring them up again. God’s promise about the new
covenant thus o?ers a lesson for each of us. Ask yourself, ‘Do I try to imitate Jehovah by not dredging up
the o?enses of others, errors that I have already said
I forgave?’ (Matt. 6:14, 15) This applies to small offenses as well as to very serious ones, such as a Christian mate’s sin of adultery. If the innocent one agrees
to forgive the repentant adulterer, is it not right to
‘remember the sin no more’? Granted, our putting
18, 19. The new covenant contains what lesson about forgiveness?

235

errors behind us may not be easy, yet it is one way
that we can imitate Jehovah.1
19

We can apply this lesson related to the new cov-

enant even as respects someone who was disfellowshipped but repented and was reinstated. What if that
person had caused you loss or had defamed you in
some way? Now he is accepted back into the congregation. How will what we read at Jeremiah 31:34 in?uence our personal thinking and response? Will we
forgive the transgressor and not keep bringing up the
wrong again? (2 Cor. 2:6-8) Truly, that is something
that all who appreciate the new covenant should try
to apply in real life.
1 God’s willingness to forgive was illustrated in Hosea’s course toward
Gomer. See the comments on Hosea 2:14-16 in Live With Jehovah’s Day
in Mind, pages 128-130.

the new covenant?
PRESENT AND FUTURE BLES SINGS
OF THE NEW COVENANT

In Jeremiah’s day, many Jews were saying, in ef-

fect: “Jehovah will not do good, and he will not do

bad.” (Zeph. 1:12) Although they had some knowledge of who Jehovah is and what he is like, they felt
that he would not take action; nor would he expect
them to live up to any standards. You, though, know
that nothing escapes divine attention. You have a respectful fear of God and de?nitely want to refrain
from doing bad. (Jer. 16:17) At the same time, you
know Jehovah to be a benevolent Father. He takes
note of our good deeds, whether others see them or
not.—2 Chron. 16:9.
21

A signi?cant aspect of the new covenant is this:

“I will put my law within them, and in their heart I
shall write it. And I will become their God, . . . And
they will no more teach each one his companion and
each one his brother, saying, ‘Know Jehovah!’ for
they will all of them know me.” (Jer. 31:33, 34) The
anointed on earth today have shown that they have
God’s law within them. They love the truths found in
it, rather than relying on the teachings of any human. And they have happily shared Bible knowledge
with those forming the great crowd. Thus, these with

an earthly hope have also come to know and love Jehovah. They willingly submit to his direction and
trust in his promises. You probably ?t that description. You know him as a Person and have a personal
relationship with him. What a bene?t that is!
22

How have you been able to strengthen your rela-

tionship with Jehovah? You no doubt remember occasions when you felt that he answered your prayers.
Through such experiences, you deepened your appreciation for the kind of God he is. You may have
sensed his assistance as you recalled a scripture that
helped you to cope with adversity. Cherish such experiences. As you keep on studying his Word, your
knowledge of him will continue to increase—an ongoing bene?t.
23

But linked to the new covenant is another bless-

ing that we can experience now. Knowing Jehovah as
the one who provides forgiveness in line with that
covenant can help free us of persistent feelings of
guilt. For example, some who had an abortion be23. How can knowing Jehovah free you from unnecessary troubling feelings?

fore they knew God’s standard may sense guilt and
sadness because they deliberately ended the life of
a developing human. Others feel that way because
they took lives when they engaged in warfare. Jesus’ ransom sacri?ce—fundamental to the new covenant—provides for forgiveness of truly repentant
ones. That being so, should we not be convinced that
if Jehovah has forgiven our sins, he views the matter
as closed? We need not dwell on the sins that Jehovah has bountifully forgiven.
24

We ?nd graphic evidence of God’s forgiveness at

Jeremiah 31:20. (Read.) Decades before Jeremiah’s
day, Jehovah punished the ten-tribe northern kingdom of Israel (represented by Ephraim, the prominent tribe) because of their idolatry. They were taken into exile. Yet, God was deeply attached to the
people of that nation and showed them tender a?ection. He still cherished them as “a fondly treated
child.” When he thought about them, his intestines
‘became boisterous,’ meaning that his deep feelings

239

were touched. This account, found in the context of
the new covenant, shows how largehearted Jehovah
is toward those who repent of past misconduct.
25

Jehovah’s promise to forgive sins through the

new covenant will reach its fullest extent at the end
of Christ’s Millennial Reign. Jesus Christ, together
with the 144,000 underpriests, will have restored to
perfection loyal humans. After the ?nal test, mankind
will then be full-?edged members of Jehovah’s universal family. (Read Romans 8:19-22.) For centuries, all
have been groaning under the burden of sin. However, Jehovah’s human creation will then have “the
glorious freedom of the children of God,” freedom
from sin and death. Consequently, be con?dent that
through the loving arrangement of the new covenant,
you can obtain abundant bene?ts. You can bene?t
now and forever through the “sprout” for David and
enjoy “righteousness in the land.”—Jer. 33:15.

God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

“I CANNOT K EEP
S ILENT ”
“HEAR the word of Jehovah.” Those words rang in
the streets and squares of Jerusalem starting in
647 B.C.E. And God’s prophet did not let up. Even
when the city was destroyed 40 years later, he repeated that exhortation. (Jer. 2:4; 42:15) Almighty
God sent prophets to make sure that the Jews could
hear His counsel and repent. As shown earlier
in this volume, Jeremiah was outstanding among
those divine spokesmen. When commissioning him,
God told Jeremiah: “You must rise up and speak to
them everything that I myself command you. Do
not be struck with any terror.” (Jer. 1:17) The
work was demanding. Jeremiah su?ered physical
and emotional pain, but despite such trials, he was
impelled to ful?ll his assignment. He said: “My

heart is boisterous within me. I cannot keep silent.”
—Jer. 4:19.
2

The way Jeremiah carried out his prophetic as-

signment set an example for future servants of Jehovah. (Jas. 5:10) Shortly after Pentecost 33 C.E.,
the Jewish authorities arrested the apostles Peter
and John, ordering them to stop preaching. You
have read their response. “We cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard.” (Acts
4:19, 20) After threatening to do worse to them the
next time, the rulers let Peter and John go. You
know the result. Those faithful men would not and
did not stop preaching.
3

Can you see how the words of Peter and John

recorded at Acts 4:20 echo Jeremiah’s fervor? As a
minister of Jehovah God in these decisive last days,
are you not just as determined in thinking, ‘I cannot remain silent!’ Let us see how we can maintain
strength like that of Jeremiah to continue preach2, 3. (a) How did Jesus’ disciples imitate Jeremiah? (b) Why should you

around us.
CONTINUE DESPITE APATHY
4

Are you not con?dent that God’s promise of a

wonderful future under his Son’s rule is the best
news that people can hear? Yet, many today express
themselves as some Jews once did by saying to Jeremiah: “As regards the word that you have spoken
to us in the name of Jehovah, we are not listening
to you.” (Jer. 29:19; 44:16) Jeremiah often heard
such sentiments. So do Jehovah’s servants today,
for many people say, “I am not interested.” Widespread apathy could sap the zeal of Kingdom publishers. If that has been true in your territory,
among some in your congregation, or even in your
case, what can be done?

a foreview of the coming divine judgment. (Read
Jeremiah 4:23-26.) The prophet could then see that
the lives of thousands depended on their hearing
the words he would speak and acting on them. Today, people are in a similar situation, including
those in your territory. Regarding “that day” of
God’s judgment against today’s wicked world, Jesus
said: “It will come in upon all those dwelling upon
the face of all the earth. Keep awake, then, all the
time making supplication that you may succeed in
escaping all these things that are destined to occur, and in standing before the Son of man.” (Luke
21:34-36) You can conclude from Jesus’ words that
those who reject the good news are in grave danger.
6

However, those who shake o? indi?erence and

who listen and respond to Jehovah’s word that we
present will receive priceless bene?ts. God is opening the way for us to escape destruction and enter
into his new world. In some respects, it was similar in Jeremiah’s ministry. The inhabitants of Ju6. Why should you keep preaching, even to those who show little interest

dah could escape. (Read Jeremiah 26:2, 3.) To help
them, Jeremiah spent decades urging the people to
“listen and return,” to heed the word of the true
God. We do not know how many repented and
changed their lives as a result of the prophet’s witnessing. But some did, and so have many in our
time. As we continue to preach the good news, we
often hear about how hearts of once unresponsive
people soften. (See the box “Apathy Can Turn Into
Interest,” on page 246.) Is that not an added reason
to stay active in our lifesaving ministry of the good
news?

APATHY CAN TURN INTO INTEREST
A householder in New Zealand said that she had
never listened to the Witnesses before, but now she
was interested. That week she had attended the funeral of a Witness because her husband worked secularly with the deceased sister’s husband. The woman noted that many present gave personal comfort
to the grieving widower. Also, she said that the clear
Biblical explanation of our resurrection hope made
sense.
The woman explained that she trained hospice
nurses, who care for the terminally ill. As a result
of the funeral, she had encouraged her students to
attend a funeral conducted by Jehovah’s Witnesses. Why? She remarked to the Witnesses at her door
that she told her students that the Witnesses explain
the true condition of the dead and o?er a beautiful
hope for the future. She felt that the nurses could
use both points to encourage their patients.
Clearly, the fact that people have long been apathetic does not mean that Jehovah cannot ‘give
them a heart to know him.’ (Jer. 24:7) Those who
have been apathetic in your territory may yet respond.

deriding him. (Jer. 15:10) Some of his enemies plotted additional ways to discredit him. (Jer. 18:18)

Others carried out an intense whispering campaign
to turn honesthearted ones away from the divine
truths Jeremiah was preaching. (Lam. 3:61, 62) Did
Jeremiah give up? On the contrary, he kept on
preaching. How did he do it?
8

Jeremiah’s main weapon in battling all the op-

position was trust in Jehovah. At the beginning of
Jeremiah’s ministry, God told him that He would
sustain and protect him. (Read Jeremiah 1:18, 19.)
Jeremiah put faith in that promise, and Jehovah did
not let him down. As opposers applied pressure
and tried more drastic measures, he grew in boldness, valor, and endurance. Notice how those qualities served him well.

On one occasion, rebellious priests and proph-

ets hauled Jeremiah before the princes of Judah to

Luke 21:12-15.
10

Recall that after listening to the prophet’s pow-

erful message, a temple o?cial named Pashhur put
him in stocks. Pashhur must have concluded that
this would teach Jeremiah a lesson and that he
would now keep quiet. So the next day, Pashhur let
him go. But Jeremiah, certainly very sore because
of the torment he had experienced, spoke directly
to Pashhur, declaring Jehovah’s judgment against
him. No, even torture did not silence Jeremiah!
(Jer. 20:1-6) Why not? Jeremiah himself tells us:
“Jehovah was with me like a terrible mighty one.
That is why the very ones persecuting me will stumble and not prevail.” (Jer. 20:11) Even when confronted by ?erce opposers, Jeremiah did not cower.
His trust in Jehovah was well-founded, and yours
can be too.
11

It is good to bear in mind that Jeremiah was

not a fanatic. He used common sense when facing

opposers. He knew when to withdraw. For instance,
consider his experience with Hananiah. After that
false prophet contradicted Jehovah’s prophetic
word in public, Jeremiah corrected him and explained how to recognize a true prophet. Jeremiah
had been carrying a wooden yoke to signify coming
under the yoke of Babylon; Hananiah got violent
and broke the yoke. Who could know what Hananiah would do next? So, what did Jeremiah do? We
read: “The prophet proceeded to go his way.” Yes,
Jeremiah left the scene. Later, at Jehovah’s direction, he returned and told Hananiah what God
would bring about—bondage to the king of Babylon for the Jews and death for Hananiah.—Jer. 28:
1-17.
12

It is clear from this inspired account that in

preaching, we do well to couple our boldness with
sound judgment. If at one home someone refuses
to accept Scriptural reasoning and becomes angry,
even threatening violence, we can excuse ourselves
courteously and move on to another house. There
“I Cannot Keep Silent”

249

is no need to have a heated argument with anyone
regarding the good news of the Kingdom. By keeping ourselves “restrained under evil,” we leave the
way open to help the householder at a more favorable time.—Read 2 Timothy 2:23-25; Prov. 17:14.
Why is trust in Jehovah so important as we preach the
good news? Why should we balance boldness with good
judgment?
“D O NOT BE AFRAID”
13

True worshippers were a?ected by the appall-

ing conditions that prevailed before Jerusalem’s destruction in 607 B.C.E. You can thus understand
why God told Jeremiah: “Do not be afraid.” (Jer.
1:8; Lam. 3:57) And Jehovah had him tell others of
his people the same encouraging words. (Read Jeremiah 46:27.) What insight can we gain from this?

God sustained Jeremiah during that truly fearful
time. Let us brie?y review what happened, in order
to see a lesson in it for us.
14

As the Babylonians tightened their grip on Je-

rusalem, hunger overtook the people. Soon many
were without food. (Jer. 37:21) As if the famine
were not enough, Jeremiah was trapped in a place
that could become his grave. The princes of Judah
had pressed weak-willed King Zedekiah to acquiesce. Then they had Jeremiah thrown into a deep
cistern. There was no water in it, just a lot of mire.
As Jeremiah began sinking into the mud, he could
see no human way out. If you had been in that situation, would you not have felt some fear?—Jer. 38:
4-6.
15

Though he was a mortal like us, Jeremiah trust-

ed Jehovah’s word that He would never abandon
him. (Read Jeremiah 15:20, 21.) Did Jehovah reward
that trust? We know for a fact that he did. God

pulled the prophet up out of the cistern, rescuing
him from death in that muddy deep.—Jer. 38:7-13.
16

Even when Jeremiah was back standing on sol-

id ground, he was not out of danger. Pleading in
Jeremiah’s behalf, Ebed-melech had told the king:
“He will die where he is because of the famine. For
there is no bread anymore in the city.” (Jer. 38:9)
Food was so scarce in Jerusalem that people were
resorting to cannibalism. Yet, Jehovah again intervened to save his prophet. And Jeremiah passed on
to Ebed-melech a guarantee of protection from
Jehovah. (Jer. 39:16-18) Jeremiah had not forgotten God’s assurance: “I am with you to deliver
you.” (Jer. 1:8) With Almighty God guarding those
two loyal men, neither human enemies nor hunger
would ?nish them o?. They escaped death in that
doomed city. What is the point? Jehovah promised
protection and ful?lled his promise.—Jer. 40:1-4.

conclusion of the system of things is moving inexorably toward its climax. In the near future, there
will occur “signs in sun and moon and stars, and
on the earth anguish of nations, not knowing the
way out . . . while men become faint out of fear and
expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth.” (Luke 21:25, 26) We must wait to see
what form those signs will take and what terror
they produce among many. No matter what develops, though, you need never doubt Jehovah’s ability and desire to save his people. The outcome for
those who do not have his favor, however, will be
quite di?erent. (Read Jeremiah 8:20; 14:9.) Even if it
seems that his servants are in a condition as hopeless as the dank, dark bottom of a cistern, he can
rescue them! God’s words to Ebed-melech will apply to his people: “ ‘I shall without fail furnish you
an escape, and by the sword you will not fall; and
you will certainly come to have your soul as a spoil,
because you have trusted in me,’ is the utterance of
Jehovah.”—Jer. 39:18.

WORDS WRITTEN FOR YOU
18

“To all those to whom I shall send you, you

should go; and everything that I shall command
you, you should speak.” (Jer. 1:7) Jeremiah’s life
changed forever when he heard that command from
God. From that moment forward, his overwhelming concern was to announce “the word of Jehovah.” That phrase appears repeatedly throughout
the book of Jeremiah. In the last chapter, Jeremiah
relates the capture of Jerusalem and the exiling of
its last king, Zedekiah. Yes, Jeremiah continued
teaching and exhorting the people of Judah to obey
Jehovah until events made it clear that his work
was complete.

preaching of the good news is by far the most signi?cant work you can do in this system of things.
By means of it, you exalt God’s great name and accept his absolute right and authority as Universal
Sovereign. (Read Lamentations 5:19.) You also demonstrate outstanding love for neighbor by helping
others to know the true God and his requirements
for life.—Jer. 25:3-6.

Regarding the work that Jehovah gave him to

do, Jeremiah said: “Your word becomes to me the
exultation and the rejoicing of my heart; for your
name has been called upon me, O Jehovah God of
armies.” (Jer. 15:16) Such rejoicing and contentment are set before all today whose hearts move
them to speak on behalf of the true God. You thus
have good reason to keep proclaiming Jehovah’s
message, as did Jeremiah.
