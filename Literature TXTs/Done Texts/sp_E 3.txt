Spirits
of the
Dead
Can They Help You
or Harm You?
Do They
Really Exist?

Such experiences are common in West Africa.
Here, as in other parts of the world, countless millions believe that dead people pass on to the spirit
world, where they are able to observe and influence
the lives of people on earth. Is this belief true? Are
the dead really alive? If not, who are those who
claim to be spirits of the dead? Knowing the correct
answers to these questions is vitally important. It
is a life-and-death matter.

Later, other angels turned
bad. These angels noticed the
good-looking women on earth
and wanted to have sexual relations with them. So they
came to the earth and put on
male human bodies. Then they
took the women for themselves.
This was against God’s purpose.
—Genesis 6:1, 2; Jude 6.
It also caused much trouble
for mankind. The wives of these
angels bore children, but they
were not normal children. They
grew to be violent and cruel
giants. Eventually the earth became so filled with violence that
Jehovah decided to destroy the
wicked people by a great flood.
The only humans who survived the Flood were righteous
Noah and his family.—Genesis
6:4, 11; 7:23.
The wicked angels, however,
returned to the spirit realm;
they did not die. But they were
punished. They were not allowed back into God’s family of
righteous angels. Furthermore,
Jehovah no longer allowed them
to put on human bodies. And
eventually they will die in the
great judgment.—2 Peter 2:4;
Jude 6.

Witnesses
Satan and the demons have
people on earth that teach and
practice wrong things. But Jehovah has a people also. They
are Jehovah’s Witnesses. (Isaiah
43:10) Throughout the earth,
there are more than six million
Witnesses. All of them try hard
to do good things and teach people the truth. In most lands,
you can meet them at the Kingdom Hall, where they will
warmly welcome you.
Their work is to help others
serve God. They will study the
Bible with you in your home,
helping you learn how to worship Jehovah in the right way.
You do not have to pay for this.
The Witnesses are happy to
teach the truth because they
love people and they love Jehovah God.

Jehovah’s Witnesses will help
you serve God
