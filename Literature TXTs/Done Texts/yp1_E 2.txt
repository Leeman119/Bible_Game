APPENDIX FOR PARENTS

“Thinking ability itself will keep guard over you,
discernment itself will safeguard you.”
—Proverbs 2:11.

To Our Dear Young People,
Your heavenly Father, Jehovah God, loves you
very much. He wants you to be happy. ‘But is it
really possible to be happy today?’ you may
wonder. The question is a good one. After all,
our lives are far from trouble-free. It seems that
challenges arise every day that could rob us of
our joy. Ah, but our loving Father has come to the
rescue! His Word provides the guidance we need in
order to navigate the rough seas of life. Although
the Bible was written a long time ago, its counsel is
just as practical today as it was when it was first
written.—Psalm 119:98, 99; 2 Timothy 3:16, 17.
We have had this publication prepared because
we love you. We want you to be happy and to get
the best out of life. To that end, we encourage you
not only to read this publication from cover to
cover but also to refer to it often as problems arise.
One of the objectives of this book is to promote
better communication between you and your
parents. We hope that you will read or even study
portions of it together. Take advantage of your
parents’ wisdom and experience!
With every good wish,

FOREWORD

Answers That Work!
‘How can I communicate with my parents?’
‘How can I make friends?’ ‘What’s wrong with casual
sex?’ ‘Why do I get so sad?’
If you’ve asked yourself such questions, you’re
not alone. Depending on where you’ve turned for guidance, you may have been given con?icting answers. To
help young people get solid advice they can rely on,
Awake! magazine launched the Bible-based series entitled “Young People Ask . . . ” in January1982. Decades
later, the series still draws an enthusiastic response. Each
article is the product of extensive research. In fact, to determine just how young people think and feel, Awake!
writers have spoken to hundreds of youths all over the
world! More important, though, the advice given in
“Young People Ask” is based on God’s Word, the Bible.
The book you now hold was originally published
in 1989. However, the chapters have been completely
revised to address the issues of today. More than 30
chapters have been adapted from “Young People Ask”
articles that were published between 2004 and 2011.
Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work,
Volume 1, will provide you with the tools you need to become a responsible adult. It is our hope that as you apply
its advice, you will join the millions of people, both young
and adult, who “through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.”
—Hebrews 5:14.

How can I talk
to my parents?
“I tried really hard to tell my parents how I felt,
but it didn’t come out right—and they just cut me
o?. It took a lot for me to get up the nerve to express
myself, and it was a complete failure!”—Rosa.

WHEN you were younger, your parents were probably the
?rst ones you ran to for advice. You told them any news, big
or small. You freely expressed your thoughts and feelings,
and you had con?dence in their advice.
Now, though, you might feel that your parents just can’t
relate to you anymore. “One evening at mealtime I began
to cry and pour out my feelings,” says a girl named Edie.
“My parents listened, but they didn’t seem to understand.”
How can I talk to my parents? 7

The result? “I just went to my bedroom and cried some
more!”
On the other hand, sometimes you might prefer not to
open up to your parents. “I talk to my parents about many
subjects,” says a boy named Christopher. “But I like it that
sometimes they don’t know everything I’m thinking.”
Is it wrong to keep some thoughts to yourself? Not necessarily—as long as you’re not being deceitful. (Proverbs 3:
32) Nevertheless, whether your parents don’t seem to understand you or you are holding back, one thing is certain:
You need to talk to your parents—and they need to hear
from you.
Keep Talking!
In some ways, communicating with your parents is like
driving a car. If you encounter a roadblock, you don’t give
up; you simply ?nd another route. Consider two examples.
ROADBLOCK 1
You need to talk, but your parents
don’t seem to be listening. “I ?nd it di?cult to communicate with my father,” says a girl named Leah. “Sometimes
I’ll talk to him for a while and then he’ll say, ‘I’m sorry, were
you speaking to me?’ ”
QUESTION: What if Leah really needs to discuss a
problem? She has at least three options.

Just as a roadblock need not be
a dead end, you can ?nd a way
to get through and communicate
with your parents!

Option

Stop talking to her dad. Leah simply
gives up trying to talk about her problem.

Option

the subject again. Leah speaks with her

talk.” (Proverbs 15:22) To deal successfully with her problems, Leah needs to talk to her dad—and if he’s going to be
of any help, he needs to know what’s going on in her life.
Ceasing to talk accomplishes neither.
With Option C, however, Leah doesn’t let a roadblock

ROADBLOCK 2
Your parents want to talk, but you’d
rather not. “There’s nothing worse than being hit with
questions immediately after a hard day at school,” says
a girl named Sarah. “I just want to forget about school,
but right away my parents start asking: ‘How was your

10 young people ask

day? Were there any problems?’ ” No doubt Sarah’s parents
ask such questions with the best of intentions. Still, she laments, “It’s hard to talk about school when I’m tired and
stressed.”
QUESTION: What can Sarah do in this situation?
As with the previous example, she has at least three options.
Refuse to talk. Sarah says:
“Please, just leave me alone. I don’t
want to talk right now!”

Option

Go ahead and talk. Despite feeling
stressed, Sarah begrudgingly answers
her parents’ questions.

Option

Delay the “school” talk but keep the
conversation going on another topic.
Sarah suggests that they discuss school
at another time, when she knows that
she’ll be in a better frame of mind. Then
she says, with genuine interest: “Tell me
about your day. How did things go for
you?”

Option

A
B
C

Which option do you think Sarah should choose? i ..........

Again, let’s explore each option to see where it would
likely lead.
Sarah is stressed and isn’t inclined to talk. If she chooses Option A, she’ll still feel stressed but she’ll also feel
guilty for blowing up at her parents.—Proverbs 29:11.
How can I talk to my parents? 11

Meanwhile, Sarah’s parents won’t appreciate her outburst—or the silence that follows. They may suspect that
Sarah is hiding something. They might try even harder to
get her to open up, which, of course, would frustrate her
more. In the end, this option leads to a no-win situation.
Option B is obviously a better choice than option A. After all, at least Sarah and her parents are talking. But since
the conversation isn’t heartfelt, neither Sarah nor her parents are going to get what they want—a relaxed, open discussion.
With Option C, however, Sarah will feel better because
the “school” talk has been delayed for now. Her parents will
appreciate her e?ort to make conversation, so they’ll be
happy too. This option likely has the best chance of success
because both sides are applying the principle found at Philippians 2:4, which says: “Look out for one another’s interests, not just for your own.”—Today’s English Version.

Avoid Sending Mixed Messages
Remember, the words you say and the message your
parents hear do not always match. For example, your parents ask you why you seem to be in a bad mood. You say,
“I don’t want to talk about it.” But your parents hear: “I
don’t trust you enough to con?de in you. I’ll talk to my
friends about the problem but not to you.” Try this exercise
by ?lling in your answers. Imagine that you are facing a dif?cult problem and your parent o?ers to help.
If you say: “Don’t worry. I can handle it myself.”
Your parents may hear: i .............................................
A better response from you might be: ..........................
..................................................................................................

The bottom line? Choose your words carefully. Deliver
them in a respectful tone of voice. (Colossians 4:6) Think of
your parents as your allies, not your enemies. And let’s face
it: You need all the allies you can get if you are to cope with
the challenges you have to deal with.
What if talking to your parents isn’t
the problem—it’s that each time you talk, you argue?

Why are

arguing?

and then compare them with those found in the box “Answers” on

It’s Wednesday night. Rachel, 17, is done with her
chores, and she’s ready for some well-earned downtime—?nally! She turns on the TV and collapses
into her favorite chair.
As if on cue, Mom appears in the doorway, and she
doesn’t look happy. “Rachel! Why are you wasting your
time watching TV when you’re supposed to be helping
your sister with her homework? You never do as you’re
told!”
“Here we go again,” Rachel mutters, loud enough to
be heard.
Mom leans forward. “What did you say, young lady?”
“Nothing, Mom,” Rachel says with a sigh, rolling her
eyes.
Now Mom is really angry. “Don’t use that tone with
me!” she says.
“What about the tone you’re using with me?” Rachel
shoots back.
Downtime is over . . . another argument has begun.

Regardless of the topic, arguing leaves you—and your
parents—feeling awful. Of course, you could just bite your
tongue and put on a show of agreeing with everything your
parents say. But does God expect you to do that? No. It is
true that the Bible tells you to “honor your father and your
mother.” (Ephesians 6:2, 3) But it also encourages you to

develop your “thinking ability” and to use your “power of
reason.” (Proverbs 1:1-4; Romans 12:1) When you do, it’s
inevitable that you will have strong convictions, some of
which may di?er from those of your parents. However, in
families that apply Bible principles, parents and youths can
communicate peacefully—even when they don’t see eye to
eye.—Colossians 3:13.
How can you express yourself without turning normal
conversation into open warfare? It’s easy to say: “That’s my
parents’ problem. After all, they’re the ones who are always
on my back!” But think: How much control do you have
over others, including your parents? Really, the only person you can change is you. And the good news is that
if you do your part to ease the tension, your parents are
more likely to remain calm and hear you out when you have
something to say.
So let’s see what you can do to put a lid on the arguing. Apply the suggestions that follow, and you might
amaze your parents—and yourself—with your newfound
communication skills.

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

“always” and “never” are not to be taken literally. They
do, however, indicate an underlying emotion. What might
it be?
Perhaps your mom is frustrated, feeling that she is burdened with more than her share of the housework. It could
be that she merely wants reassurance that she has your
support. If that’s the case, saying “Why are you nagging
me?” will get you nowhere—except maybe into an argument! So instead, why not put your mom at ease? For example, you could say: “I can see you’re upset, Mom. I’ll do
the dishes right away.” A caution: Do not lace your words
with sarcasm. Respond with empathy, and your mom will
be more likely to soften and tell you the real problem.1

make that could provoke you—if you let it.

How can I earn
more freedom?
“I wish my parents would let me venture out a
little.”—Sarah, 18.
“I’m always asking my parents why they don’t trust
me when I want to go out with a group of friends.
Often, they tell me: ‘We trust you. We just don’t
trust your friends.’ ”—Christine, 18.

LIKE Sarah and Christine, do you yearn for more freedom?
To get it, you’ll need to gain the trust of your parents. But
trust is a lot like money. Earning it is hard, losing it is easy,
and no matter how much you’re given, it may never seem
to be enough. “Whenever I want to go out,” says 16-yearold Iliana, “my parents bombard me with questions about
where I’m going, the people I’m going with, what I’ll be doing, and when I’ll be back. I know they’re my parents, but it
irritates me when they question me like that!”
What can you do to get your parents to trust you more
and give you more freedom? Before answering that question, let’s look at why trust is such a hot-button topic between many parents and youths.
Growing Pains
The Bible acknowledges that “a man will leave his father
and his mother.” (Genesis 2:24) Of course, the same can be
said of a woman. Whether you’re a male or a female, a vital
objective of adolescence is to prepare you for adulthood
—the time when you’ll be equipped to leave home and perhaps raise a family of your own.1
However, the transition to adulthood isn’t like a door
that you simply walk through when you reach a certain
age. It’s more like a stairway that you climb, step-by-step,
throughout adolescence. Granted, you and your parents
may have con?icting opinions as to just how far you’ve progressed up that stairway. “I’m

“My parents think that I wouldn’t have the strength to walk
away from a bad situation. I’ve tried telling them that I have
already walked away from bad situations, but that’s not
good enough for them!”
As Maria’s comments reveal, the issue of trust can be a
source of considerable tension between youths and parents.
Is that true in your family? If so, how can you earn greater
trust from your parents? And if you’ve lost their trust because of some unwise actions on your part, what can you do
to repair the damage?
Prove Yourself Trustworthy
The apostle Paul wrote to
?rst-century Christians: “Keep
proving what you yourselves
are.” (2 Corinthians 13:5) True,
he wasn’t primarily addressing
adolescents. Still, the principle
applies. The degree to which
you’re accorded freedom often

you prove yourself trustworthy. Not that you have to be
perfect. After all, everyone makes mistakes. (Ecclesiastes
7:20) Overall, though, does your pattern of behavior give
your parents reason to withhold their trust?
For example, Paul wrote: “We wish to conduct ourselves
honestly in all things.” (Hebrews 13:18) Ask yourself, ‘What
kind of track record do I have when it comes to being up
front with my parents about my whereabouts and activities?’
Consider the comments of a few youths who have had to
take a hard look at themselves in this regard. After you’ve
read their comments, answer the questions listed below.
Lori: “I was secretly e-mailing a boy I liked. My parents
found out about it and told me to stop. I promised that I
would, but I didn’t. This went on for a year. I’d e-mail the boy,
my parents would ?nd out, I’d apologize and promise to
stop, but then I’d do it again. It got to the point where my
parents couldn’t trust me with anything!”

Regaining Trust
What if, like the youths quoted above, your actions have
contributed to your parents’ lack of trust? Even if that’s the
case, be assured that you can turn the tide. But how?
Likely your parents will accord you greater trust and
freedom as you build up a record of responsible behavior.
Annette came to appreciate that fact. “When you’re younger,” she says, “you don’t fully appreciate the importance
of being trusted. Now I feel more responsible, and I feel

compelled to act in a way that will help me retain my parents’ trust.” The lesson? Rather than complain about your
parents’ lack of trust in you, focus on building up a record of
trustworthy behavior. You will likely earn more freedom.
For example, are you dependable in the areas listed below? Put a  in the box next to any traits you need to
work on.
i O Keeping my curfew
O Following through on my promises

In time, your advancement will be manifest to others, including your parents.—1 Timothy 4:15.
But what if you feel that despite your best e?orts, your
parents aren’t giving you the freedom you deserve? Why
not talk over the matter with them? Instead of complaining
that they need to be more trusting, respectfully ask them
what they think you need to do to earn their trust. Explain
your goals clearly in this regard.
Don’t expect your parents to make concessions immediately. No doubt they’ll want to make sure that you’ll make
good on your promises. Use this opportunity to prove yourself trustworthy. In time, your parents may well accord you
greater trust and freedom. That was the case with Beverly,
quoted earlier. “It’s much harder to gain trust than it is to
lose it,” she says, adding, “I’m gaining trust right now, and

Why did dad and
mom split up?
“I was home with Mom the day Dad left us. I was
only six, so I didn’t understand what was going on.
I was sitting on the ?oor watching TV, and I could
hear my mom sobbing and begging my dad to stay.
He came downstairs with a suitcase, knelt down,
gave me a kiss, and said, ‘Daddy will always love
you.’ Then he walked out the door. I didn’t see my
dad for a long time after that. Since then, I have
been afraid that Mom would leave too.”—Elaine, 19.

IF YOUR parents divorce, it can seem like the end of the
world, a catastrophe that generates enough misery to last
forever. It often triggers a wave of shame, anger, anxiety,
fear of abandonment, guilt, depression, and profound loss
—even a desire for revenge.
If your parents have recently split up, you might be experiencing similar feelings, and no wonder, for our Creator
meant for children to be raised by both a father and a mother. (Ephesians 6:1-3) Now you have been deprived of the
daily presence of a parent, one you may have deeply loved.
“I really looked up to my father and wanted to be with him,”
says Daniel, whose parents split up when he was seven.
“But Mom got custody of us.”
Why Parents Break Up
Often, a split-up comes as a surprise to the children
because parents have kept their problems well hidden. “I
was in shock,” says Rachel, who was 15 when her parents
divorced. “I always thought that they were in love.” Even
when parents do squabble, it may still come as a blow when
they actually split up!
In many cases the split-up occurs because one parent is
guilty of sexual misconduct. Under those circumstances,
God does permit the innocent mate to obtain a divorce
and be free to marry again. (Matthew 19:9) In other cases, “wrath and screaming and abusive speech” have erupted into violence, causing one parent to fear for his or her
physical well-being and that of the children.—Ephesians
4:31.
Admittedly, some couples split up for less compelling
reasons. Rather than work out their problems, some selfishly divorce because they claim they are “unhappy” or “no
longer in love.” This is displeasing to God, who “has hated
Why did dad and mom split up? 29

a divorcing” of that kind. (Malachi 2:16) Jesus implied that
some families might be disrupted when one mate becomes
a Christian.—Matthew 10:34-36.
Whatever the case, the fact that your parents may have
chosen to be silent or to give you only vague answers to
your questions regarding the divorce does not mean they
do not love you. Wrapped up in their own hurt, your parents may simply ?nd it hard to talk about the divorce. (Proverbs 24:10) They may also ?nd it awkward and embarrassing to admit to their mutual failures.
What You Can Do
Identify your fears. Because divorce can turn your
world upside down, you may ?nd yourself worrying about
things that you formerly took for granted. Even so, you may
be able to shrink your fears to a manageable size by ?rst
identifying what they are. Below, put a  next to what you

experts feel that the worst of a divorce
is over within three years. That may seem like a long time,
but remember, a lot has to happen before your life can stabilize.
For one thing, the household routine—disrupted by the
divorce—must be reorganized. Time will also pass before
your parents are back on their feet emotionally. Only then

How can

my parent’s
remarriage?
YOUR parent might be so happy on the day he or she remarries. You, though, might feel
anything but joy! Why? The remarriage of a parent destroys
the hope that your biological parents will ever get back together. On the other hand, the remarriage can be particularly painful if it comes on the heels of the death of a beloved parent.

pain in destructive ways.

For example, you might constantly make life di?cult
for your stepparent. You might even try to cause trouble between your parent and your stepparent, hoping to
break them up. However, a wise proverb warns: “He who
brings trouble on his family will inherit only wind”—that
is, he will end up with nothing. (Proverbs 11:29, New International Version) You don’t have to fall into that trap.
You can cope with your emotional turmoil in more productive ways. Consider a few examples.
Challenge 1: Coping With
the Authority of a Stepparent
Coming under the authority of a new parent is not
easy. When asked to do something, you may be tempted to
blurt out, ‘You’re not my real mother/father!’ Such a response may give you a brief surge of satisfaction, but it betrays an immature attitude.
On the other hand, accepting the authority of your stepparent is one way to show that you have heeded the Bible’s
counsel to “grow up in your thinking.” (1Corinthians 14:20,
The Holy Bible in the Language of Today, by William Beck)
Really, your stepparent performs the duties of a natural
parent and deserves your respect.—Proverbs 1:8; Ephesians 6:1-4.
A stepparent’s discipline is usually an expression of his
or her love and concern for you. (Proverbs 13:24) “My stepdad does discipline us,” says Yvonne, 18, “but that’s what
normal fathers are supposed to do. I feel that if I resent his
counsel, then I’m saying that it doesn’t matter that he has
provided for us materially and spiritually over the years.
And that would be ungrateful.”
Still, you may have legitimate grounds for complaint.
If so, prove yourself to be ‘grown up’ by doing as Colossians 3:13 urges: “Continue putting up with one another
How can I deal with my parent’s remarriage? 35

and forgiving one another freely if anyone has a cause for
complaint against another.”

Challenge 2: Learning to Share and to Compromise
“My dad ended up remarrying twice,” recalls 24-year-old
Aaron. “I found it di?cult to feel a?ection for each new
stepfamily. At ?rst, they were just strangers, but I was told
that I was under compulsion to love them. I found the situation confusing.”
You too may face di?cult challenges. For example, you
might have to relinquish your position as the oldest or the
only child. If you are a son, you may for a long time have
felt you were the man of the house—a position now occupied by your stepfather. Or you may relate to Yvonne.
“My biological dad never paid any attention to Mom,” she
says, “so I was used to having her all to myself. But when

men,” recommends the Bible. (Philippians 4:5) The original
word translated “reasonableness” meant “yielding” and conveyed the attitude of one who did not insist on all his lawful
rights. How can you apply that counsel? (1) Avoid dwelling

If your sibling constantly annoys you—bossing you
around or invading your space—it might be hard not to let
resentment build. But a Bible proverb says: “The squeezing
of the nose is what brings forth blood, and the squeezing
out of anger is what brings forth quarreling.” (Proverbs 30:
33) If you hold a grudge, it will result in an angry outburst
just as surely as squeezing your nose will cause blood to
?ow. Then the problem will only get worse. (Proverbs 26:
21) How can you prevent an irritation from bursting into a
raging argument? A ?rst step is to identify the real issue.
Incident or Issue?
Problems between siblings are like pimples. The surface
evidence of a pimple is an unsightly sore, but the cause is
an underlying infection. Similarly, an ugly clash between
siblings is often just the surface evidence of an underlying
issue.
You could attempt to treat a pimple by squeezing it. But
you would only be dealing with the symptom, and you may
leave a scar or aggravate the infection. A better approach
is to deal with the infection and thus prevent further outbreaks. It’s similar when it comes to problems with siblings.
Learn to identify the underlying issue, and you will get past
the incident and right to the root of the problem. You’ll also
be able to apply the advice of wise King Solomon,
who wrote: “The insight of a man certainly slows
down his anger.”—Proverbs 19:11.
Problems between siblings are
like pimples—to ?x them you need
to treat the underlying cause, not
just attack the symptom

For example, Alice, quoted earlier, said about her brother Dennis, “He barges into my room and ‘borrows’ things
without asking.” That’s the incident. But what do you think
is the real issue? Likely, it’s related to respect. Alice could
deal with the problem by telling Dennis never to come into
her room or use her things. But that approach treats only
the symptom and would likely lead to further con?ict. However, if Alice could convince Dennis to respect her privacy
and her property, their relationship would no doubt improve.
Learn to Resolve or Avoid Con?icts
Of course, identifying the underlying issues you have
with a sibling is only part of the solution. What can you do
to resolve an issue and avoid a future confrontation? Try
taking the following six steps.
1. Agree to some ground rules. Look back at what you
indicated caused con?ict between you and your sibling. See
if together you can work out some rules that you both agree
on and that address the underlying issue. For example,
if you clash over possessions,
Rule 1 could be: “Always ask
DID YOU KNOW . . .
before taking an item that beWhen you leave home,
longs to someone else.” Rule 2
you will at times be
could be: “Respect a sibling’s

That way you will make rules
that both you and your sibling

can live by. Then check with your parents to make sure that
they approve of your rules.—Ephesians 6:1.
2. Abide by the rules yourself. The apostle Paul wrote:
“Do you, however, the one teaching someone else, not
teach yourself? You, the one preaching ‘Do not steal,’ do
you steal?” (Romans 2:21) How can you apply that principle? If you want your sibling to respect your privacy, for instance, then you likewise need to knock before entering
your sibling’s room or ask before reading his or her e-mails
or text messages.
3. Don’t be quick to take o?ense. Why is that good advice? Because, as a Bible proverb states, “only fools get angry quickly and hold a grudge.” (Ecclesiastes 7:9, Contemporary English Version) If you are easily o?ended, your life
will be miserable. Yes, your siblings will do or say things
that upset you. But ask yourself, ‘Have I done something
similar to them in the past?’ (Matthew 7:1-5) “When I was

Rather than obsess about your siblings’ faults, why not
?nd an opportunity to tell them what it is that you admire
about them?—Psalm 130:3; Proverbs 15:23.
The Bible acknowledges that a brother or a sister might
not always be the closest companion you will have. (Proverbs 18:24) But you can strengthen your friendship with
your siblings if you “continue putting up with one another,”
even when they give you valid “cause for complaint.” (Colossians 3:13) If you do so, your siblings are likely to become less irritating to you. And you may even annoy them
less!

ROLE MODEL

Jacob
Jacob and his brother, Esau, have not spoken in years.
In fact, Esau hates Jacob. Even though Jacob has done
nothing wrong, he is the one who takes the initiative to
heal the rift. He makes concessions. His aim is not to win
an argument but to win his brother’s a?ection. Jacob
doesn’t compromise his principles, but neither does he insist on an apology before making peace with his brother.
—Genesis 25:27-34; 27:30-41; 32:3-22; 33:1-9.
How do you handle disputes with your family members? Sometimes you may feel that you are clearly right
and your sibling or parent is clearly wrong. In such situations do you wait for the other person to make the ?rst
move? Or can you be like Jacob? When Bible principles are
not at stake, will you be willing to make concessions for
the sake of peace? (1 Peter 3:8, 9) Jacob didn’t let pride divide his family. He humbled himself and won back his
brother. Will you do the same with your family members?

Am I ready to
leave home?

“I sometimes feel that people are looking down
on me because I’m 19 and still living at home, like
I won’t be an adult until I live on my own.”—Katie.
“I’m nearly 20, and I hate it that I have very little
say about how my life is run. I’ve considered leaving
home.”—Fiona.

LONG before you’re ready to leave home, you may begin to
feel a desire for independence. That feeling is normal. After
all, as discussed in Chapter 3, God’s original purpose was
for youths to grow up and eventually leave their father and
mother and establish their own family unit. (Genesis 2:23,
24; Mark 10:7, 8) But how can you know when you’re truly ready to leave home? Consider three important questions you need to answer. The ?rst is . . .
Am I ready to leave home? 49

What Are My Motives?
Look at the list below. Number in order of importance
the reasons why you want to leave home.
i ...... Escape problems at home
...... Gain more freedom
...... Improve my status with my friends
...... Help out a friend who needs a roommate
...... Help with volunteer work in another location
...... Gain experience
...... Ease the ?nancial burden on my parents
...... Other ..................................................

The reasons listed above are not necessarily bad. The
question is, What is your motive? For example, if you leave
just to escape restrictions, you’re likely in for a shock!
Danielle, who left home for a while when she was 20,
learned a lot from the experience. She says: “We all have to
live with restrictions of some sort. When you’re on your
own, your work schedule or lack of ?nances will restrict
what you can do.” Carmen, who moved overseas for six
months, says: “I enjoyed the experience, but I often felt
that I had no free time! I had to keep up with the normal
housework—cleaning the apartment, ?xing things, pulling
weeds, washing clothes, scrubbing ?oors, and so on.”
Don’t allow others to rush you into a decision. (Proverbs
29:20) Even if you have valid reasons for leaving home,
you’ll need more than good intentions. You’ll need survival
skills—which leads to the second question . . .

of the skills necessary to run a household.

you learn to manage money?
A Bible proverb says: “A wise person will listen and take

parents how much it’s likely to cost each week for one person to cover the rent or mortgage, buy food, and run a car
or pay other transportation costs? Then have your parents
help you learn how to budget your money and pay the
bills.1

to run away from con?icts, not to resolve them.”
O Personal spiritual routine: Some leave home with
the speci?c intention of escaping their parents’ religious
routine. Others fully intend to maintain a good personal program of Bible study and worship but soon drift into
bad habits. How can you avoid ‘shipwreck of your faith’?1
—1 Timothy1:19.
Jehovah God wants all of us to prove to ourselves the

having to prod you to do so?
Finally, the third question you need to consider is . . .

Do you want to leave home to get away from problems?

That approach is like trying to drive with your eyes ?xed
on the rearview mirror—you’re so preoccupied with what
you’re moving away from that you’re blind to what is ahead.
The lesson? Don’t just concentrate on moving away from
home—have your eyes ?xed on a worthwhile goal.
Some young adults among Jehovah’s Witnesses have
moved so that they can preach in other locations within
their country or even overseas. Others move to help with
the construction of places of worship or to work at a branch
o?ce of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Still others feel that they
should live by themselves for a time before they get married.1
Whatever your goal may be, think it through. “The plans
of the diligent one surely make for advantage,” states a
Bible proverb, “but everyone that is hasty surely heads
for want.” (Proverbs 21:5) Listen to your parents’ advice.
(Proverbs 23:22) Pray about the matter. And as you make
up your mind, consider the Bible principles just discussed.
The real question is not Am I ready to leave home? but
Am I ready to manage my own household? If the answer to
that latter question is yes, then you may well be ready to
strike out on your own.
1 In some cultures it is customary for a child, particularly a daughter, to live at

“If I’m angry, I need someone to vent to. If I’m sad,

Furthermore, the Bible states that “a true companion is
loving all the time, and is a brother that is born for when
there is distress.” (Proverbs 17:17) That’s probably describing a deeper kind of friendship than you found as a child at

Admirable Qualities
What you should know. Not everyone who claims to be
a friend has what it takes to live up to the label. The Bible
even says that “there exist companions disposed to break
one another to pieces.” (Proverbs 18:24) That might sound
extreme. But consider: Have you ever had a “friend” who
took advantage of you? What about one who talked behind
your back or spread false rumors about you? Such an experience can shatter your trust.1 Always remember that when

How can I resist
temptation?

Karen is at the party for no more than ten minutes
when she sees two boys arrive carrying several large
paper bags. What’s in those bags is no mystery.
Earlier, she had overheard the same boys saying that
there would be “lots of booze” at this party.
Suddenly, Karen hears a familiar voice behind her.
“What are you just standing there for, Miss Boring?”
Karen turns to see her friend Jessica clutching two
freshly opened bottles of beer. Jessica holds one
right in front of Karen’s face and says, “Now don’t tell
me you’re too young to have a little fun!”
Karen wants to refuse. But the pressure to accept
is more powerful than she expected. Jessica is her
friend, and Karen doesn’t want to come across as . . .
“Miss Boring,” as Jessica called her. Besides,
Jessica’s one of the good girls. And if she’s drinking,
then what’s the big deal? ‘It’s just a beer,’ Karen tells
herself. ‘It’s not like taking drugs or having sex.’

WHEN you’re young, temptation comes in many forms.
Often, it involves the opposite sex. “The girls at school are
aggressive,” says 17-year-old Ramon. “They like to touch
you and to see how far they can go with you. They won’t
take no for an answer!” Deanna, also 17, found the same
thing to be true. “One boy came up to me and put his arm
around me,” she says. “I punched him in his arm and said:
‘What are you doing? I don’t even know you!’ ”
You too may face temptations, and it might seem as
if the pressure just won’t let up. Continuous temptation
can be like repeated knocking on your door in spite of the
“Do Not Disturb” sign. Do you hear that knock more often
than you’d like? For example, do any of the following tempt
you?
i O Smoking
O Looking at pornography
O Drinking alcohol
O Taking drugs

O Engaging in sex
O Other..........................................

If you put a  next to any of the above, don’t conclude
that you’re just not cut out to be a Christian. You can learn
to control wrong desires and to resist temptation. How?
It helps to recognize what’s behind temptation. Consider
three factors.
1. Imperfection. The inclination to do wrong is common to all imperfect humans. Even the apostle Paul—a
mature Christian—candidly admitted: “When I wish to do
what is right, what is bad is present with me.” (Romans 7:
21) Clearly, even the most upright person will occasionally
become aware of “the desire of the ?esh and the desire of
the eyes.” (1 John 2:16) But dwelling on enticements to do
wrong only makes matters worse, for the Bible says: “Desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin.”—James
1:15.
How can I resist temptation? 65

2. External in?uences. Temptation is everywhere you
look. “At school and at work, people talk about sex all the
time,” says Trudy. “On TV and in movies, it’s always made
to seem so glamorous, so exciting. You rarely see the negative consequences!” Trudy knows from experience how
powerful the in?uence of peers and the media can be. “I
thought I was in love at 16,” she recalls. “My mother sat
down with me and told me that if things kept going the way
they were, I would end up pregnant. I was horri?ed that my
mom would think such a thing! Two months later, I was
pregnant.”
3. “The desires incidental to youth.” (2 Timothy 2:
22) That phrase can include any desire that is typical of
young people, such as the craving for acceptance or the
yearning to forge your own identity. Those desires aren’t
wrong in themselves, but if left unchecked, they can make
temptation harder to resist. For example, the longing for
your own identity could drive

to be controlled by your cravings? Have the maturity to control your urges rather than allow your urges to control you.
(Colossians 3:5) And make it a matter of prayer that you
continue to do so.—Matthew 6:13.1

‘But I’m too young to worry about my health!’ you might

good health is a vital key to reaching each one of those goals.
Granted, your feelings might be similar to those of 17year-old Amber, who says, “No way could I stick to eating
whole wheat and low-fat, sugar-free food all the time!” If
that’s how you feel, don’t worry—you don’t have to give
up sweets completely and jog outrageous distances every
week. Really, it may take just a few simple adjustments
for you to start looking better, feeling great, and performing at your best. Let’s see how some of your peers have
done it.

Eat Right—Look Better!

“I made a lifestyle change”
“I was an overweight teenager, which was something
I never wanted to be. I was so unhappy with the way I
looked and felt! From time to time, I tried to lose weight
with some special diet, but I always gained it back. So
when I was 15, I decided enough was enough. I wanted to
lose weight the right way—a way that I could maintain for
the rest of my life. I bought a book that discussed basic
nutrition and exercise principles, and I incorporated what
I read into my life. I was determined that even if I ‘fell o?
the wagon’ or got discouraged, I would not give up. Guess
what? It worked! Over the course of one year, I lost
60 pounds. I’ve maintained my desired weight for two
years. I never thought it would happen! I think the reason

Secret to Success: Don’t skip meals! If you do, you’ll feel
starved and tend to overeat.
Exercise More—Feel Great!
The Bible says: “Bodily training is bene?cial.” (1 Timothy
4:8) Yet, many young ones don’t seem too eager to exercise.
“You wouldn’t believe how many kids failed gym when I
was in high school. It was the easiest class, next to lunch!”
—Richard, 21.
“Some think, ‘Why run around outside in the hot sun until you’re sweaty and tired when you can play a video game

emotionally it’s a great relief.”
Payo? 13. Exercise can increase your fun. “I love the
outdoors,” says Ruth, 22, “so my exercise includes hiking,
swimming, snowboarding, and biking.”
Secret to Success: Devote at least 20 minutes three
times a week to a vigorous physical activity that you enjoy.

Sleep Better—Perform at Your Best!
The Bible says: “Better is a handful of rest than a double
handful of hard work and striving after the wind.” (Ecclesiastes 4:6) Without proper sleep, your performance will
nosedive!
“If I don’t get enough sleep, I’m out of it. I have trouble focusing on anything!”—Rachel, 19.
“At about 2:00 p.m., I get so tired that I could almost fall
asleep in the middle of a conversation!”—Kristine, 19.

peers have done.

Avoid late nights. “I’ve been making an e?ort to get to
bed at a decent hour,” says 18-year-old Catherine.
Cut out the chatter. “Sometimes friends would call or
text me really late,” says Richard, 21, “but I’ve recently
learned to end the conversation and just go to sleep.”
Aim for consistency. “Lately,” says 20-year-old Jennifer, “I’m trying to go to bed and get up at the same time every
day.”
Secret to Success: Strive to get at least eight hours of
sleep each night.
You have everything to gain by taking just a few simple steps to take care of yourself. Remember, having good
health will help you to look better, feel great, and perform at
your best. Unlike certain things in life, your physical condition is something over which you do have a degree of control. “In the end,” says 19-year-old Erin, “your health depends on only one person—you.”

What can I wear?

Heather is ready to walk out the door, and her
parents can’t believe their eyes.
“You’re wearing that?” her dad blurts out.
“Why not?” Heather replies, sounding astonished.
“I’m just going to the mall with friends.”

WARDROBE wars are nothing new. Your parents may
have fought similar battles with their parents when they
were your age. And back then, they probably felt the same
way you feel today! But now they’ve switched sides, and
the issue of what you can wear causes one skirmish after
another.
You say: It’s comfortable.
They say: It’s sloppy.
You say: It’s so adorable!
They say: It’s so provocative.
You say: It’s half price.
They say: It should be. . . . Half of it is missing!
Is there any way to declare a cease-?re? Yes! Megan,
23, has learned the secret. “There doesn’t have to be an argument,” she says. “There can be an agreement.” Agreement? Does that mean you have to dress like a 40-yearold? Relax! To agree just means that you and your parents
discuss your di?erences and brainstorm other options that
they—and you—can be happy with. The bene?ts?
1. You’ll look your best, even to your peers.
2. Your parents will be less likely to criticize what you
wear.
3. After seeing how responsible you are in this area,
your parents may even grant you other freedoms.

could read all the Scriptural admonition that directly relates to the subject in just a couple of minutes! In that time,
though, you would ?nd solid, valuable guidelines. For example:
? The Bible advises women to adorn themselves “with
modesty and soundness of mind.”1—1 Timothy 2:9, 10.
The word “modesty” might make you worry. ‘Do I have
to wear a sack?’ you may wonder. Not at all! In this context, modesty means that your clothes show you have selfrespect and consideration for others’ feelings. (2 Corinthians 6:3) A wide variety of clothing ?ts those criteria. “It
might be challenging,” says Danielle, 23, “but you can be
fashionable without wearing extreme styles.”
? The Bible says that when it comes to appearance,
you should focus on “the secret person of the heart”—or,
as Today’s English Version renders it, “your true inner self.”

the way women practically throw themselves at men by
what they wear!” says 16-year-old Brittany. Kay would
agree. Describing a former friend, she says: “Everything
she wore had ‘look-at-me’ written all over it. She wanted
the attention of the guys, and to get it she would wear the
most eye-catching out?ts she could ?nd.”
Get Your Parents’ Input
Stu?ng a daring out?t into your backpack and changing into it at school is not the way to go. You’ll gain more
trust from your parents if you’re open and honest with
them, even in things that you think you could get away
with. In fact, you’d probably do well to seek out their opinion when you’re considering an out?t. (Proverbs 15:22)

But why would you want to ask for their opinion? Isn’t

Bible principles discussed in this chapter apply to
boys too. Be modest. Let your secret person of the heart
—your true inner self—shine through. When considering an
item of clothing, ask yourself: ‘What will it say about me?
Does that “statement” re?ect who I really am?’ Remember, clothing is a form of expression. Make sure that your
clothes re?ect the ideals you believe in!

3:20) Still, once you understand their views—and they,
yours—you might be surprised at how often you can come
to an agreement. As a result, the wardrobe wars may ?nally be over!
Fashion Tip: When trying on clothing, think of more
than what you see in the mirror. A seemingly modest out?t may change when you sit down or bend over to pick up
something. If possible, get the opinion of a parent or a mature friend.

Give of Yourself
Key scripture. “There is more happiness in giving than
there is in receiving.”—Acts 20:35.
What it means. When you help others, you help yourself. How? “Generosity will be rewarded,” states a Bible
proverb. “Give a cup of water, and you will receive a cup of
water in return.” (Proverbs 11:25, Contemporary English
Version) There’s no denying it—your sense of well-being
soars when you help others!1

Key scripture. “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”—Romans 3:23.
What it means. There’s no getting around it—you’re
imperfect. That means there will be times when you will say

The value of money does not
lessen because it is torn—nor
does your value in God’s eyes
lessen because of imperfection

Your True Value
The Bible says that
“God is greater than our
hearts.” (1 John 3:20) This
means, for one thing, that
he can see value in you that
you may not see in yourself. But do your imperfections
change that? Well, imagine that you had a $100 bill with
a small tear in it. Would you throw it away or view it as
worthless because of that tear? No way! It’s still worth $100
—with or without a tear.
It’s similar with God’s view of your worth. Your ?aws
don’t blind him to your value. He notices and treasures your
e?orts to please him, no matter how insigni?cant they may
seem to you! Indeed, the Bible assures you that “God is not
unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you
showed for his name.”—Hebrews 6:10.

How can I
stop being
so sad?

“When everyone else falls apart, I’m there to ?x
their problems and make them feel better. But then
—and this is the part that few people see—I go
home to my room and cry.”—Kellie.
“When I’m down, I isolate myself. If I get invited
somewhere, I come up with an excuse not to go.
I do a good job at hiding my sadness from my
family. They think I’m ?ne.”—Rick.

HAVE your thoughts ever been similar to those of Kellie
or Rick? If so, don’t hastily conclude that there’s something wrong with you. The fact is, everyone gets sad now
and then. Even faithful men and women of the Bible did.
—1 Samuel 1:6-8; Psalm 35:14.
91

In some cases, you may know why you are sad; in other cases, you may not. “You don’t have to be in a horrible
situation to feel sad,” says 19-year-old Anna. “It can come
on at any time, even if your life is trouble free. It’s weird, but
it happens!”
Regardless of the cause—or even if there doesn’t seem
to be one—what can you do when sadness holds you in its
grip? Try the following:
1. Talk about it. In the midst of his turmoil, Job said: “I
will speak in the bitterness of my soul!”—Job 10:1.
Kellie: “The relief I feel after talking to someone is
amazing. Finally, someone knows what I’m going through.
They can lower the rope and pull me out of the pit—saved
at last!”

you could con?de when sadness overwhelms you.

Of course, nearly everyone has one or more of those

ROLE MODEL

Job
Job’s world is turned upside down. First, he loses his
means of livelihood. Second, he loses his children in death.
Third, he loses his health. All of this happens quickly and
without warning. In utter despair, Job says: “My soul certainly feels a loathing toward my life.” He describes himself
as “glutted with dishonor and saturated with a?iction.” (Job
10:1, 15) Even in the midst of adversity, however, Job refuses to turn his back on his Creator. (Job 2:10) The changes in
his life do not change him. Job thus stands as an example
of endurance.
When confronted with problems, you too might feel a
‘loathing toward your life.’ Still, like Job, you can show
yourself unchanging in the midst of change, unwavering
in your determination to serve Jehovah God. James wrote:
“Look! We pronounce happy those who have endured.
You have heard of the endurance of Job and have
seen the outcome Jehovah gave, that Jehovah is
very tender in a?ection and merciful.” (James 5:
11) He cared for Job, and he cares for you!

end it all?

“I AM better o? dead than alive.” Who said those words?
Someone who didn’t believe in God? Someone who had left
God? Someone whom God had left? None of the above.
The speaker was the devout but distraught man Jonah.
—Jonah 4:3, Today’s English Version.
The Bible doesn’t say that Jonah was about to take his
life. Nevertheless, his desperate plea reveals a sobering fact
—at times even a servant of God can be overwhelmed by
anguish.—Psalm 34:19.
Some youths feel such intense anguish that they see no
reason to continue living. They may feel as did 16-year-old
Laura, who states: “For years, I have had recurring bouts of
depression. I often think about killing myself.” If you know
someone who has expressed a desire to end it all—or if
you have considered that idea yourself—what can you do?
Let’s take a closer look at why such a thought might occur.
Behind the Despair
Why would anyone consider taking his or her own life?
A number of factors could be involved. For one thing, we
live in “critical times hard to deal with,” and many adolescents feel the pressures of life with great intensity. (2 Timothy 3:1) Then, too, human imperfection can cause some to
harbor deeply negative thoughts about themselves and the
world around them. (Romans 7:22-24) Sometimes this is
because of mistreatment. In other cases, a medical issue
may be involved. Signi?cantly, in one country it is estimated that more than 90 percent of those who did take their life
were su?ering from some type of mental illness.1
Of course, no one is immune to adversity. Indeed, the
Bible says that “all creation keeps on groaning together
1 It is important to note, however, that most youths who have a mental illness do
not commit suicide.

Why not just end it all? 99

if you feel overwhelmed
Even some faithful men and women of the
Bible occasionally felt overwhelmed by life’s anxieties.
Consider some examples.
Rebekah: “If this is the way it is, just why am I alive?”
—Genesis 25:22.
Moses: “Please kill me o? altogether, . . . and let me
not look upon my calamity.”—Numbers 11:15.
Elijah: “O Jehovah, take my soul away, for I am no
better than my forefathers.”—1 Kings 19:4.
Job: “O that in Sheol you would conceal me, . . . that
you would set a time limit for me and remember me!”
—Job 14:13.
In each of the above cases, the situation eventually
changed for the better—and in a way that the su?erer
could not have foreseen. Be assured that the same can
be true for you!

young people. In fact, youths can be profoundly a?ected by
negative events, such as the following:
? The death of a relative, friend, or pet
? Family con?ict
? Academic failure
? The breakup of a romance
? Mistreatment (including physical or sexual abuse)
Admittedly, sooner or later virtually all youths encounter one or more of the situationslisted above. Why are some
better equipped to ride out the storm than others? Experts

say that youths who want to give up the ?ght feel utterly
helpless and hopeless. In other words, such youths see no
light on the horizon. They don’t really want to die; they just
want to end the pain.
No Way Out?
You might know someone who wants to end the pain
—so much that he or she has expressed a desire to stop
living. If that is the case, what can you do?
If a friend is distressed to the point of wanting to die,
urge that person to get help. Then, regardless of how he or
she feels about it, talk to a responsible adult. Don’t worry
about ruining your friendship. By reporting the matter, you
may well save your friend’s life!
But what if you yourself have had thoughts of ending it
all? Don’t keep your feelings to yourself. Talk to someone
—a parent, a friend, or anyone else who cares and who
will listen to your concerns and take you seriously. You
have nothing to lose—and everything to gain—by talking
out your problems.1
Granted, your problems won’t disappear just because
you’re talking them out. But the support of a trusted con?dant may be just what you need to put your situation in
perspective. It may even help you to work out some practical solutions.
Things Change
When undergoing distress,
remember this: No matter how
dire a situation may seem, in
time things will change. At one

point, the psalmist David, who was no stranger to adversity, was able to say to God in prayer: “You have changed my

David certainly didn’t expect the dancing to last forever.
He knew from experience that life’s problems ebb and ?ow.
Have you noticed that to be true with your problems? Some
of them may seem overwhelming—at least for now. But be
patient. Things change, often for the better. In some cases,
problems might be alleviated in ways that you couldn’t have

that you hadn’t considered. The point is, distressing problems will not stay the same forever.—2 Corinthians 4:17.

Prayer is not a mere crutch. It is real communication
with your heavenly Father, who wants you to “pour out
your heart” to him. (Psalm 62:8) Consider the following basic truths about God:
? He is aware of the circumstances that contribute to
your distress.—Psalm 103:14.
? He knows you better than you know yourself.

When the Problem Is Health Related
As mentioned earlier, suicidal feelings are often rooted
in some type of illness. If that’s the case with you, do not be
ashamed to seek help. Jesus acknowledged that those who
are ailing need a physician. (Matthew 9:12) The good news
is that many conditions can be treated. And treatment may
help you to feel much better!1
The Bible o?ers a truly comforting promise—that in
God’s new world, “no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’ ” (Isaiah
33:24) God says that at that time, “the former things will
not be called to mind, neither will they come up into the
heart.” (Isaiah 65:17) In the meantime, do your best to cope
with life’s challenges, con?dent that in God’s due time, depression will be a thing of the past.—Revelation 21:1-4.

Is it wrong to want
some privacy?

Put a  next to your most likely response
in each of the following scenarios:
1. You’re in your bedroom with the door closed,
and your sibling barges in without knocking.
i O ‘No problem. Sometimes I do the same thing to my sibling.’
O ‘How rude! What if I’d been getting dressed?’

2. You just got home, and now both parents
start plying you with questions. “Where did
you go? What did you do? Who went along?”
O ‘No problem. I usually tell them everything anyway.’
O ‘How frustrating! My parents just don’t trust me!’

WHEN you were younger, privacy probably wasn’t such a
big deal. If your younger sibling barged into your room, you
welcomed the company. If your parents asked you a question, you answered without hesitation. Back then, your life
was an open book. Now you may wish you could close the
cover. “I like it when I can just keep some things to myself,”
says 14-year-old Corey. Let’slook at two areas where trying
to get some privacy might pose a challenge.
When You Seek Solitude
There are a number of valid reasons for you to seek out
solitude. Perhaps you just want to “rest up a bit.” (Mark 6:
31) Or when you want to pray, you may, as Jesus advised
his disciples, “go into your private room and, after shutting
your door, pray to your Father.” (Matthew 6:6; Mark 1:

What you can do. Rather than turn the privacy issue

yourself. If needed, see if your parents can help in this regard.1
? When it comes to your parents, strive to understand
their viewpoint. “At times, my parents check up on me,”

make sure there is nothing you are doing that is contributing to the problem.—James 1:19.
When You Make Friends
During adolescence, it’s normal for you to form friendships outside your family. It’s also normal for your parents to wonder who your friends are and what you’re doing
when you are with them. But at times you may feel that
their concern borders on paranoia. “I just want to have my
cell phone and my e-mail without my parents’ looking over
my shoulder every ten minutes to ask me who I’m talking
to,” says 16-year-old Amy.
What you can do. Instead of letting your friendships
create a barrier between you and your parents, try the following:
? Bring your friends out into the open, and make sure
your parents are acquainted with them. After all, you might
not like your parents’ playing detective, but what choice do
they have if your friends are a mystery? Remember, the
more your parents know about the people you’re spending
time with, the more comfortable they’re likely to be about
your choice of friends.
? Be honest with yourself: Is the issue privacy, or is
it secrecy? Brittany, 22, says: “If you’re living at home
and your parents have a concern, your thought should be,
‘What I’m doing isn’t bad, so why should I have to hide it?’

parent in death is to savor
every moment you had with

memories down so you don’t

Don’t hold back the tears! Crying helps ease the pain
of grief. However, you may feel the way Alicia did. She was

if I showed too much emotion, it would seem to others that
I lacked faith.” But think: Jesus Christ was a perfect man
who had strong faith in God. Yet, he “gave way to tears”
when he saw those who were bereaved over the death of his
dear friend Lazarus. (John 11:35) So don’t be afraid to let
your tears ?ow. It does not mean that you lack faith! Alicia

her mother died. “There was one time that I didn’t do that.
The next morning, Mom passed away. As unrealistic as it
sounds, I feel guilty for not having seen her that last night
—and for the chain of events that occurred the next morning. My dad left on a business trip and wanted me and my
sister to look in on Mom. But we slept late. When I went
into the bedroom, Mom wasn’t breathing. I felt terrible, because she was OK when Dad left!”
Like Karyn, perhaps you feel a measure of guilt for
things you neglected to do. You might even torture yourself
with “if onlys.” ‘If only I had urged Dad to see a doctor.’ ‘If
only I had checked on Mom earlier.’ If such thoughts plague
you, remember this: It’s normal to feel regret over things
you wish you had done di?erently. The fact is, you would
have done things di?erently had you known what would
happen. But you did not know. Therefore, guilt is inappropriate. You are not responsible for your parent’s death! 1

for you to deal with your grief. On the other hand, discussing your feelings with someone you trust will open the way
for you to receive “kind words” of encouragement when you
need them most.
Talk to God. Likely, you will feel much better after you
“pour out your heart” to Jehovah God in prayer. (Psalm
62:8) This is not simply a ‘feel-good therapy.’ In prayer, you
are appealing to “the God of all comfort, who comforts us in
all our tribulation.” (2 Corinthians 1:3, 4) One way that God
provides comfort is through his Word, the Bible. (Romans
15:4) Why not keep handy a list of scriptures that are comforting to you?1
Grieving is not an overnight process. But the Bible can
provide comfort, for it assures us that in the new world that

Why am
I afraid to
share my
faith at
school?
“There have been some great opportunities to
talk about my beliefs at school. But I let them
pass.”— Kaleb.
“Our teacher asked the class what we thought
about evolution. I knew this was a perfect chance
to share my faith. But I completely froze and said
nothing. Afterward, I felt really bad.”— Jasmine.
121

IF YOU are a Christian youth, perhaps you can relate to
the experiences of Kaleb and Jasmine. Like them, you may
love the Bible-based truths you have learned. You may
even want to share them with others. Still, you might dread
the thought of speaking up. But you can develop more
courage. How? Take the following steps:
1. De?ne your fears. When you think about sharing
your faith, it’s easy to imagine the worst-case scenario!
Sometimes, though, you can shrink your fears simply by
putting them into words.
Complete the following sentence:
? This is what I fear might happen if I talk about my beliefs at school: i ....................................................................
..................................................................................................

If it’s any comfort, your fears may be a lot like those of
other Christian youths. For instance, 14-year-old Christopher admits, “I’m afraid kids will make fun of me and
tell everyone I’m weird.” And Kaleb, quoted at the outset,
says, “I was worried someone would ask a question and I
wouldn’t know the answer.”
2. Accept the challenge. Are your fears completely unfounded? Not necessarily, as 20-year-old Ashley
recalls. “Some kids pretended

that my Bible had been changed. I was stunned! I didn’t
know what to say.”1
Situations like these can seem pretty scary! But instead
of running away, accept such challenges for what they are
—a normal part of your life as a Christian. (2 Timothy 3:
12) “Jesus said his followers would be persecuted,” says
13-year-old Matthew, “so we can’t expect everyone to like
us for our beliefs.”—John 15:20.
3. Think of the bene?ts. Can any good come out of a
seemingly bad experience? Amber, 21, thinks so. “It’s hard
to explain your faith to people who don’t respect the Bible,” she says, “but it helps you to understand your own position better.”—Romans 12:2.
Look again at the scenario you described in Step 1.
Think of at least two good things that could come out of
that situation, and write them below.

4. Be prepared. “The heart of the righteous one meditates so as to answer,” says Proverbs 15:28. Besides meditating on what you’ll say, try to anticipate questions others
may ask. Research those topics, and plan out answers you
feel comfortable giving.—See the chart “Plan Your Response,” on page 127.
5. Get started. Once you’re ready to talk about your
beliefs, how should you start? You have options. In a
sense, sharing your faith is like swimming: Some people
ease their way into the water; others jump right in. Likewise, you could start the conversation on a nonreligious
subject and gradually test the water, so to speak. But if
you ?nd yourself worrying too much about what might go
wrong, your best option may be to ‘jump right in.’ (Luke

6. Be sensible. “Sensible people always think before
they act,” wrote Solomon. (Proverbs 13:16, Today’s English Version) Just as you wouldn’t dive into shallow waters, be careful not to jump into pointless arguments. Remember, there’s a time to speak and a time to keep quiet.

(Ecclesiastes 3:1, 7) At times, even Jesus refused to answer questions.—Matthew 26:62, 63.
If you do choose to reply, you might keep it brief and be
discreet. For example, if a classmate taunts, ‘Why don’t
you smoke cigarettes?’ you could simply say, ‘Because I’m
not into body pollution!’ Depending on the response, you
can decide whether or not to explain your beliefs further.
The six steps outlined in this chapter can help you to be
“ready to make a defense” of your faith. (1 Peter 3:15) Of
course, being ready doesn’t mean that you’ll never feel nervous. But Alana, 18, observes: “When you explain your beliefs despite being scared, it makes you feel as if you’ve accomplished something—you’ve overcome your fear and
taken the risk that it might not go well. And if it does go
well, you’ll feel even better! You’ll be glad you had the courage to speak up.”

How can I cope with
stress at school?
“I felt so much pressure at school that I often
felt like crying and screaming at the same time.”
— Sharon.

“Stress at school doesn’t let up when you get
older—the reasons for it just change.”— James.
128 young people ask

DO YOU feel that your parents just don’t understand how
much stress you’re under at school? They might tell you that
you don’t have a mortgage to pay o?, a family to feed, or an
employer to please. Likely, though, you feel that at school
you face as much pressure as your parents do—or more.
Just getting to and from school can be stressful. “Fights
often broke out on the school bus,” says Tara, who lives in
the United States. “The driver would stop, and everyone
would have to get o?. We would all be delayed by half an
hour or more.”
Does the stress let up once you arrive at school? Hardly!
Perhaps you face the following:
? Teacher-induced stress.
“My teachers want me to excel and get the best grades
possible, and I feel pressure to gain their approval.”
—Sandra.
“Teachers push students to excel academically, especially if the student has some ability.”—April.
“Even if you have worthwhile goals for your life, some
teachers make you feel like dirt if you don’t pursue the academic goals that they think you should.” 1—Naomi.

Four Steps to Less Stress
Realistically, you can’t expect to make it through school
without having to deal with some kind of stress. Granted,
too much stress can be oppressive. Wise King Solomon
wrote: “Mere oppression may make a wise one act crazy.”

than he can carry, and he picks up the
weights correctly. If he takes such steps,
he builds strong muscles without damaging his body. On the other hand, if he fails
to take these steps, he can tear a muscle or
even break a bone.
Similarly, you can manage the stresses that you encounter and successfully accomplish the work you need to do
without causing damage to yourself.
How? Take the following steps:
1. Identify the speci?c causes.
“When you see trouble coming, don’t
be stupid and walk right into it—be smart and hide,” states
a wise proverb. (Proverbs 22:3, Contemporary English Version) But you can’t hide from oppressive stress unless you
?rst identify the most likely cause. So look back at what you
placed a  next to earlier. Which stress factor a?ects you
the most right now?
2. Do research. For example, if a heavy load of homework is stressing you out, research the suggestions found in
Chapter 13 of Volume 2. If you feel pressured to engage in
sexual misconduct with a classmate, you’ll also ?nd helpful
advice in Chapters 2, 5, and 15 of that volume.
3. Don’t procrastinate. Few problems will disappear if
you ignore them. Instead, they usually become worse, thus
increasing your stress. Once you’ve decided how you will
deal with a particular stress, don’t delay. Do it right away.

Good Stress?
You might ?nd it hard to believe, but the fact that you feel
some stress is actually a good thing. Why? It indicates that
you’re diligent and that your conscience hasn’t become lazy.
Note how the Bible describes an individual who seemed to
feel no stress at all: “How long will you lie there doing nothing at all? When are you going to get up and stop sleeping?
Sleep a little. Doze a little. Fold your hands and twiddle your
thumbs. Suddenly, everything is gone, as though it had been
taken by an armed robber.”—Proverbs 6:9-11, Contemporary English Version.
Heidi, 16, sums up the matter well. She says: “School
may seem like a really bad place, but the pressures you
face there are the same ones you’ll face in the workforce.”
True, coping with stress isn’t easy. But if managed properly,
stress won’t harm you. In fact, it can make you a stronger
person.

school for at least ten years. So, there is no set age or grade
that applies to everyone equally around the world.
In addition, some countries or states may allow a student to take some or all of his or her classes from home,
without going to a regular school. Students who are homeschooled—with their parents’ permission and cooperation,
of course—are not quitting.
However, if you’re thinking of ending your school career
before you graduate—either regular school or school at
home—you need to consider the following questions:
What does the law require? As mentioned, laws governing the amount of schooling a student must have di?er
from place to place. What is the minimum schooling that
the law in your area requires? Have you reached that stage
yet? If you ignore the Bible’s counsel to be “in subjection to
the superior authorities” and you leave before that grade,
you are quitting.—Romans 13:1.
Have I achieved my educational goals? What are the
goals that you want your education to help you achieve?
Not sure? You need to know! Otherwise, you’re like a train

What honorable reasons did you write? A couple of possibilities might be to help support your family ?nancially or

Look again at the list you wrote above, and honestly
rate from 1 to 5 the reasons why you want to quit school
(1 indicating less important, 5 most important). If you drop
out just to escape problems, you are likely in for a shock.
What’s Wrong With Quitting?
Quitting school is like jumping o? a train before you

and the passengers unfriendly. But if you leap from the

school, you may not reach
your educational goals and
you will cause yourself both
immediate and long-term
problems, such as the following:
Immediate problems:
You will likely ?nd it more di?cult to get a job. And if you do
get one, it will probably be lower paying than one you might
have obtained if you had completed your schooling. To support a basic standard of living, you may then have to work
longer hours in surroundings that will likely be even less
pleasant than your current school environment.
Long-term challenges: Research shows that those who
drop out of school are more likely to have poorer health, to
end up in prison, and to have to rely on social welfare programs.
Of course, completing school is no guarantee that you’ll
avoid those problems. But why unnecessarily handicap
yourself by dropping out?

“Because I persisted, I have mastered the fundamentals of reading and writing. School has taught me how to
bene?t from criticism and how to express myself clearly
and logically—skills that are useful in my Christian ministry.”—Ryan.
“School has improved my problem-solving ability,
whether in the classroom or elsewhere. Figuring out ways
to deal with academic, social, and physical challenges has
really helped me to mature.”—Cindy.
“School has helped prepare me for the challenges of the
work environment. Also, I faced many situations that forced
me to examine the reasons for my faith, so being at school
has strengthened my religious convictions.”—Rose.
Wise King Solomon wrote: “Better is the end afterward
of a matter than its beginning. Better is one who is patient
than one who is haughty in spirit.” (Ecclesiastes 7:8) So
rather than quit, patiently work through the problems you
face at school. If you do, you will ?nd that the end afterward
will be much better for you.
What if one reason you hate school
is that you can’t get along with your teacher?

YOU can choose your friends, but for much of your early
life, you can’t choose your teachers. Maybe you like all of
them. David, 18, says: “I never really had problems with any
of my teachers. I respected them, and they liked me.”
On the other hand, you may have a teacher similar
to the one described by 11-year-old Sarah. “She is super
mean. And I can’t understand her. She either doesn’t explain enough about a lesson, or she describes way too
much.” To help you get along with your teacher, you ?rst

What can help you to cope? A ?rst step is to apply the
counsel given by the apostle Peter. He wrote: “All of you
be like-minded, showing fellow feeling.” (1 Peter 3:8) What
could possibly move you to have fellow feeling for a “mean”
teacher? Consider some facts about teachers that might
help you.
Teachers are fallible. They have their fair share of
quirks, problems, and, yes, prejudices. “If anyone does not
stumble in word,” wrote the disciple James, “this one is a
perfect man, able to bridle also his whole body.” (James
3:2) Brianna, 19, says: “My math teacher wasn’t very patient and would often scream at us. So we found it hard to
respect her.” What contributed to this situation? “The class
was always chaotic,” says Brianna, “and the kids would act
crazy just to make the teacher more upset.”

your mistakes and shortcomings, especially if you’ve been

Teachers have favorites. Consider the challenges facing your teachers: How many of the students in your classes want to be there? How many of those who do want to be
there are willing and able to concentrate on one topic for
half an hour or more? How many students like to vent their
pent-up frustrations and hostility on teachers? Now imagine that you had the job of teaching 20, 30, or even more of
your peers and that the topic was one that few of them
wanted to consider. Wouldn’t you be inclined to give more
attention to those who seemed interested?
True, it may irritate you when you see what seems to be
blatant favoritism. Natasha says of one of her teachers: “He
set a deadline for assignments but always made exceptions
for the football players—and no one else. It just so happened that he was also the assistant coach of the team.” If
something similar happens to you, ask yourself, ‘Are my
educational needs being ignored?’ If not, why be upset or

True, friendly manners and talk will not always win over
a teacher. But be patient. King Solomon wrote: “Patience
and gentle talk can convince a ruler [or teacher] and overcome any problem.” (Proverbs 25:15, Contemporary English Version) Remain calm and speak mildly when treated unfairly. Your teacher may reassess his opinion of you.

Resolving Speci?c Issues
Understanding your teacher’s limitations is only a start.
What can you do to resolve a speci?c issue? For example,
how might you deal with the following complaints?
I deserve a better grade. “I always got A’s,” says Katrina. “But one year my science teacher gave me an F. I deserved better. My parents talked to the principal. But he
only raised the grade to a D, so I was still pretty mad.” If you
face a similar issue, don’t ?re o? a salvo of accusations
against your teacher. Instead, learn from the Bible character Nathan. He had the di?cult task of exposing a serious shortcoming on the part of King David. Nathan did
not barge into the palace shouting accusations, but he approached David tactfully.—2 Samuel 12:1-7.

Likewise, you might humbly and calmly approach your
teacher. If you throw a tantrum or accuse your teacher of
incompetence or worse, you’ll hardly win an ally. Try a more
adult approach. Begin by asking your teacher to help you to
understand his grading system. “Listen before you answer,”
wrote Solomon. “If you don’t, you are being stupid and insulting.” (Proverbs 18:13, Today’s English Version) Once
you’ve listened, you may be able to point out where you feel
an oversight was made. Even if your grade is not changed,
your maturity will probably make a positive impression on
your teacher.
I feel that my teacher is prejudiced. Consider Rachel’s experience. She had been receiving A’s and B’s on
her report cards. Then, when she reached Grade 7, things
changed. “My teacher did everything he could to make me
fail his class,” says Rachel. What was the problem? The
teacher made it obvious to both Rachel and her mother that

courage to speak to your parents about it. They, no doubt,
will be interested in speaking to the teacher and possibly
the school administration to work out a solution.
Take a Long-Range View
Admittedly, not all tangled a?airs have neat endings. At
times, you just have to endure. “One of my teachers had a
bad attitude toward his students,” says Tanya. “He often insulted us, calling us stupid. At ?rst he made me cry, but I
learned not to take his insults personally. I focused on my
work and kept myself busy in his class. As a result, he didn’t
bother me much, and I was one of the few who received decent grades. After two years, that teacher was ?red.”

ROLE MODEL

Moses
Moses has many advantages in life. He was raised in
the royal household of Pharaoh and educated in all the
wisdom of Egypt. (Acts 7:22) What will he do with his
training? He could gain fame, fortune, and power. However, he is not swayed by peer pressure nor enticed by selfish ambition. Instead, he makes a career choice that no
doubt surprises many. He chooses “to be ill-treated with
the people of God.” (Hebrews 11:25) Does Moses lose out?
No. Because of choosing to serve God and help people,
he enjoys an exciting, rewarding life.
If you are fortunate enough to have access to a good
basic education, what will you do with that advantage?
You could chase after money or power. Or, like Moses, you
could do something truly worthwhile with your life. You
could use your mental and physical assets to serve God
and your neighbors. (Matthew 22:35-40) No other course
of life is as rewarding!

TIME is like a spirited horse—if it is to
work for you, you must learn to control
it. Control your time, and you will likely reduce your stress, improve your grades, and gain more
trust from your parents. “Sounds great,” you say, “but it’s
easier said than done!” True, you will face challenges. But
you can overcome them. Let’s take some examples.

Challenge 11: Making a Schedule
What might stop you. Just the thought of scheduling
makes you feel trapped! You like to be spontaneous, not tied
to a plan.
Why do it anyway. King Solomon wrote: “The plans of
the diligent one surely make for advantage.” (Proverbs 21:5)
150 young people ask

=

“Make sure of the more important things.”
—Philippians 1:10.
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

Solomon was a busy man. He was a husband, a father, and
a king. And his life likely got busier as he grew older. Similarly, your life is busy now. But it will probably become more
hectic as you grow older. Better that you become organized
sooner rather than later!
What your peers say. “About six months ago, I started planning my schedule regularly. I was trying to make
things easier, and having a schedule seemed to do the trick!”
—Joey.
“Lists help keep me on track. When I have an extraheavy load, my mom and I write it all down to ?gure out how
we can help each other reach our goals.”—Mallory.
What will help you. Look at it this way: Suppose you’re
going on a road trip. Each family member randomly throws
his or her bags into the trunk of the car. It looks as though
there won’t be enough room for everything. What can you
do? You might start again, putting the biggest bags in ?rst
and ?tting the smaller bags into the remaining space.
The same strategy can be used to manage your life. If
you start ?lling up your time with smaller things, you risk not
being able to ?t in the important things. Make space for the
big things ?rst, and you’ll be amazed at how much more time
you’ll have for the rest!—Philippians 1:10.

What you can do. Get a pocket planner, and prioritize
what you need to do. On the other hand, perhaps one of the
following alternatives below would work for you.

O Computer calendar

O Small notepad
O Desk calendar

Challenge 12: Sticking to a Schedule
What might stop you. After school you just want to relax and watch TV for a few minutes. Or you plan to study for
a test, but you get a text message inviting you to a movie.
The movie won’t wait, but you can put o? studying until tonight. ‘Besides,’ you tell yourself, ‘I seem to do better under
pressure.’
Why do it anyway. You may earn a better grade if you
study when your mind is more alert. Plus, don’t you already
have enough pressure to deal with? Why add to it by cramming for a test late at night? What will the next morning
be like? You may oversleep, feel more stress, have to rush
out the door, and possibly be late for school.—Proverbs 6:
10, 11.
What your peers say. “I love watching TV, playing the
guitar, and being with friends. These things aren’t wrong; but
sometimes they push the more important things back, and I
end up rushing.”—Julian.

Voeun was three when she and her Cambodian parents

angry because I didn’t understand his attitude and way of
thinking.”
O A language barrier at home. Ian was eight when he

Noor, quoted earlier, says: “My father tried hard to insist that we speak his language at home, but we didn’t want
to speak Arabic. To us, learning Arabic seemed like extra
baggage to carry. Our friends spoke English. The TV programs we watched were all in English. Why did we need

you could try to erase all trace of your cultural background
and blend in with your new surroundings. However, such a
course would likely o?end your parents and lead to frustration for you. Instead, why not learn to cope with the challenges and make the most of your circumstances? Consider the following suggestions:
How to view ridicule. No matter what you do, you are
never going to be popular with everyone. People who enjoy
ridiculing others will always ?nd an excuse to do so. (Proverbs 18:24) So don’t waste your breath trying to correct
their prejudiced views. “Those who sneer at others don’t
like to be corrected,” observed wise King Solomon. (Proverbs 15:12, Contemporary English Version) Prejudiced
comments only expose the speaker’s ignorance, not the
victim’s so-called faults.
How to deal with an identity crisis. It’s only natural to want to belong to a group, such as a family or
a culture. But it’s a mistake to think that your worth is
determined by your cultural or family background. People may judge you on that basis, but God doesn’t. “God
is not partial,” said the aposTIP
tle Peter. “In every nation the

How to bridge the culture gap at home. Parents and
children in almost every family will have di?erences in viewpoint. In your case, those di?erences might be ampli?ed
—your parents want you to live by the customs of the old
country, but you want to adopt the customs of your new
home. Even so, if you desire things to go well in your life,
you must “honor your father and your mother.”—Ephesians 6:2, 3.
Rather than rebelling against your parents’ customs because they don’t suit you, try to discern the reason why
your parents respect those customs. (Proverbs 2:10, 11)
Ask yourself the following questions: ‘Do the customs con?ict with Bible principles? If not, what speci?cally is it about
the customs that I dislike? How could I respectfully convey
my feelings to my parents?’ (Acts 5:29) Of course, it will be
much easier to honor your parents—to understand their
thinking and express your feelings—if you know how to
speak their language well.
How to overcome the language barrier at home.
Some families have found that if they insist on speaking
only their mother tongue while at home, the children will
have the advantage of learning both languages well. Why
not try that in your home? You may also want to ask your
parents to help you learn to write the language. Stelios,
who grew up in Germany but whose ?rst language is Greek,
says: “My parents used to discuss a Bible text with me each
day. They would read it out loud, and then I would write it
down. Now I can read and write both Greek and German.”

A Bridge, Not a Barrier
Will you view your cultural background as a barrier that
divides you from others or as a bridge that links you to
them? Many young Christians have realized that they have
an added reason for bridging the gap between cultures.
They want to tell other immigrants about the good news of
God’s Kingdom. (Matthew 24:14; 28:19, 20) “Being able

Salomao, who immigrated to London when he was ?ve. “I
had almost forgotten my ?rst language, but now that I am
in a Portuguese congregation, I can speak both English and
Portuguese ?uently.”
Noor, quoted earlier, saw the need for evangelizers who
could speak Arabic. She says: “Now I am taking classes
and trying to pick up what I lost. My attitude has changed.
Now I want to be corrected. I want to learn.”
Certainly, if you are familiar with two cultures and can
speak two or more languages, you have a real advantage.
Your knowledge of two cultures increases your ability to understand people’s feelings and to answer their questions
about God. (Proverbs 15:23) “Because I understand two
cultures,” says Preeti, who was born in England to Indian
parents, “I feel more comfortable in the ministry. I understand people from both ways of life—what they believe and
what their attitudes are.”
Can you too view your circumstances as an advantage
rather than a liability? Remember, Jehovah loves you for
who you are, not for where you or your family came from.
Like the youths quoted here, can you use your knowledge
and experience to help others of your ethnic background to
learn about our impartial, loving God, Jehovah? Doing so
can make you genuinely happy!—Acts 20:35.

How can I explain
the Bible’s view of
homosexuality?
The awards ceremony erupts into a frenzy when
two popular actresses greet each other with a
passionate kiss! Onlookers gasp in shock, then
cheer in support. Gays call it a triumph. Skeptics
call it a publicity stunt. Video clips of the kiss will
be aired repeatedly on TV newscasts—and elicit
millions of hits on the Internet—for days to come.

AS ILLUSTRATED in the above scenario, few events create
more media buzz than when a celebrity hints at or comes
out as being gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Some people praise
such ones for their courage; others condemn them for their

debauchery. Between the two viewpoints, many see homosexuality as nothing more than an alternative lifestyle.
“When I was in school,” says Daniel, 21, “even straight kids
felt that if you had a problem with the idea of homosexuality, you were prejudiced and judgmental.”
Attitudes about homosexuality may di?er from one generation to another or from one land to another. But Christians aren’t “carried hither and thither by every wind of
teaching.” (Ephesians 4:14) Instead, they adhere to the Bible’s view.
What is the Bible’s view of homosexuality? And if you
live by the Bible’s moral code, how can you respond to
those who label you prejudiced, judgmental, or even homophobic? Consider the following questions or statements
and possible responses.
“What does the Bible say about homosexuality?”
“The Bible makes it clear that God designed sex to be
engaged in only between a male and a female and only
within the arrangement of marriage. (Genesis 1:27, 28;
Leviticus 18:22; Proverbs 5:18, 19) When the Bible condemns fornication, it is referring to both homosexual and illicit heterosexual conduct.”1—Galatians 5:19-21.

what about bisexuality?
Although found among both genders, bisexuality
seems to be increasingly common among girls. For some,
it’s a matter of curiosity. Lisa, 26, says: “When you put
something out there in movies, TV, and music that promotes girls kissing girls, teens will be tempted to try it
—especially when they do not consider it to be wrong.”
For others, there seems to be a genuine attraction.
“I met two bisexual girls at a party,” says Vicky, 13, “and
later I found out from a friend that they liked me. Eventually I started texting one of the girls, and I started developing feelings for her.”
Have you ever felt the way Vicky did? Many would
urge you simply to embrace your sexuality and come out
as bisexual. However, you should be aware that same-sex
attraction is often nothing more than a passing phase.
That’s what Vicky found out. So did 16-year-old Lisette.
She says: “Talking to my parents about my feelings made
me feel better. Also, through my biology classes in school,
I learned that during the adolescent years, hormone levels
can ?uctuate greatly. I truly think that if youths knew
more about their bodies, they would understand that
same-sex attraction can be temporary, and they wouldn’t
feel the pressure to be gay.”
Even if your feelings seem more deep-rooted than a
short-lived growing pain, realize that the Bible presents
you with a reachable goal: You can choose not to act on
wrong desires, no matter what they are.

“Jesus didn’t encourage his followers to accept any and
all lifestyles. Rather, he taught that the way to salvation is
open to ‘everyone exercising faith in him.’ (John 3:16) Exercising faith in Jesus includes conforming to God’s moral code, which forbids certain types of conduct—including
homosexuality.”—Romans 1:26, 27.
“Homosexuals can’t change their orientation;
they’re born that way.”
“The Bible doesn’t comment on the biology of homosexuals, although it acknowledges that some traits are
deeply ingrained. (2 Corinthians 10:4, 5) Even if some are
oriented toward the same sex, the Bible tells Christians to
shun homosexual acts.”
Suggestion: Rather than get ensnared in a debate about
the cause of homosexual desires, emphasize that the Bible
prohibits homosexual conduct. To make a comparison, you
could say: “You know, many claim that violent behavior can
have a genetic root and that as a result, some people are
predisposed to it. (Proverbs 29:22) What if
that was true? As you might know, the Bible condemns ?ts of anger. (Psalm 37:8;
Ephesians 4:31) Is that standard unfair
just because some may be inclined toward violence?”
“How could God tell someone
who is attracted to people of the
same sex to shun homosexuality? That sounds cruel.”

Remember this: Homosexuals, along with most people,
have some ethical code that causes them to deplore certain
things—perhaps fraud, injustice, or war. The Bible prohibits those behaviors; it also draws the line at certain types of
sexual conduct, including homosexuality.—1 Corinthians
6:9, 10.
The Bible is not unreasonable, nor does it promote prejudice. It simply directs those with homosexual urges to do
the same thing that is required of those with an oppositesex attraction—to “?ee from fornication.”—1 Corinthians
6:18.
The fact is, millions of heterosexuals who wish to conform to the Bible’s standards employ self-control despite
any temptations they might face. Their number includes
many who are single with little prospect of marriage and
many who are married to a disabled partner who is unable
to function sexually. They are able to live happily without
ful?lling their sexual urges. Those with homosexual inclinations can do the same if they truly want to please God.

How can I conquer the
habit of masturbation?
“I began masturbating when I was eight years
old. Later I learned God’s view of the matter. I felt
terrible every time I gave in. ‘How could God love
someone like me?’ I asked myself.”—Luiz.

WHEN you reach puberty, sexual desires can become particularly strong. As a result, you might fall into a habit of
masturbation.1 Many would say that it’s not a big deal. “No
one gets hurt,” they argue. However, there’s good reason to
avoid the practice. The apostle Paul wrote: “Deaden, therefore, your body members . . . as respects . . . sexual appetite.” (Colossians 3:5) Masturbation does not deaden sexual appetite but fuels it. In addition, consider the following:
? Masturbation instills attitudes that are totally selfcentered. For example, when masturbating, a person is immersed in his or her own body sensations.
? Masturbation causes one to view those of the opposite sex as mere objects, or tools, for self-grati?cation.
? The sel?sh thinking that is instilled through the practice of masturbation can make satisfying sexual relations in
marriage di?cult to achieve.
Rather than resort to masturbation to relieve pent-up
sexual urges, strive to cultivate self-control. (1 Thessalo1 Masturbation is not to be confused with involuntary sexual arousal. For example, a boy might wake up sexually excited or have a nocturnal emission of semen.
Similarly, some girls might ?nd that they are stimulated unintentionally, particularly just before or after their menstrual period. In contrast, masturbation involves deliberate sexual self-stimulation.

nians 4:4, 5) To help you to do that, the Bible recommends
that you avoid circumstances that might arouse you sexually in the ?rst place. (Proverbs 5:8, 9) Still, what if you
have become enslaved to the habit of masturbation? Perhaps you’ve tried to stop but without success. It would be
easy to conclude that you’re a lost cause, that you’re incapable of living up to God’s standards. That’s how a boy
named Pedro viewed himself. “When I relapsed, I felt terrible,” he says. “I thought that I could never atone for what I
had done. I found it hard to pray.”
If that’s how you feel, take courage. Your case isn’t
hopeless. Many young people—and adults—have overcome the habit of masturbation. You can too!
Dealing With Guilt
As already noted, those who have fallen into the habit of
masturbation are often plagued with guilt. Without a doubt,
being “saddened in a godly way” can give you the incentive
to overcome the habit. (2 Corinthians 7:11) But excessive
guilt can be counterproductive. It can make you feel so discouraged that you just want to give up the ?ght.—Proverbs
24:10.

A fall while running does not
mean that you have to start
over—nor does a relapse with
masturbation erase the progress you’ve already made

that you have committed the unforgivable sin. The key is to
resist the urge and never to give up your ?ght!
It is easy to become downhearted after a relapse. When
that occurs, take to heart the words of Proverbs 24:16:
“The righteous one may fall even seven times, and he will
certainly get up; but the wicked ones will be made to stumble by calamity.” A temporary setback does not make you a
wicked person. So do not give up. Instead, analyze what led
to the relapse, and try to avoid repeating the same pattern.
Take time to meditate on God’s love and mercy. The
psalmist David, who was no stranger to personal weakness, stated: “As a father shows mercy to his sons, Jehovah
has shown mercy to those fearing him. For he himself well
knows the formation of us, remembering that we are dust.”

get to that point. No words could have lifted my spirits and
determination more.
“My father then showed me a few scriptures to help me

course. He said to ‘keep the slate clean’ until a certain time,
and we would discuss it again then. He told me not to let it

“Having someone else aware of my problem and helping

Know Why Casual Sex Is Wrong
Fornication is so serious a sin that those who practice it
“will not inherit God’s kingdom.” (1Corinthians 6:9, 10) Of
course, that’s true whether two people are “in love” or engaging in casual sex. To resist temptation in either situation,
you must view the practice of fornication as Jehovah does.
“I ?rmly believe that Jehovah’s way is the best way to
live.”—Karen, Canada.
“Remember that you are somebody’s son or daughter,
a friend to many people, and part of a congregation. You
would let all these people down if you gave in!”—Peter, Britain.
By adopting Jehovah’s view of fornication, you will be
able to “hate what is bad,” even if it appeals to the ?esh.
—Psalm 97:10.

Remember, casual sex is no casual matter to Jehovah
God; neither should it be to you. By taking a stand for
what’s right, you can preserve a clean conscience before
God and maintain self-respect. As a girl named Carly puts

grati?cation? Take care of what you have worked so hard to
maintain!”

DO YOU worry that boys are not attracted to you?
Many girls do, even the ones you think would have
no problems! Take Joanne, for example. She’s goodlooking, intelligent, and articulate. Yet, she says: “I often
feel that boys don’t like me. A few that I liked showed an
interest in me for a while but later stopped talking to me
completely!”
What types of things do young men ?nd attractive in
a girl? What do they ?nd unattractive? What can you do
to catch the attention of a decent young man?
What to Do
? Know your own mind and heart. You likely felt
an increased attraction to boys soon after you entered
puberty. You may have felt drawn to more than one
boy. That’s normal. But if you had quickly given your
heart to the ?rst boy who made your pulse race, you
would have risked stunting your emotional and spiritual growth. It takes time to develop positive personality
traits, to ‘make your mind over’ on important matters,
and to reach some of your own goals.—Romans 12:2;
1Corinthians 7:36; Colossians 3:9, 10.
True, many boys are attracted to girls who have not
yet formed strong convictions or who are naive. However, such boys are primarily interested in the girl’s
body, not in who she is as a person. The fact is, a balanced young man will look for a girl who can bring her
strengths to a partnership.—Matthew 19:6.
What boys say: “I ?nd it attractive when a girl is
able to form opinions for herself, when she seems to
have the inner conviction that she’s a person in her own
right.”—James.

pretty girls. But that can quickly cool o? if the

goals. On the other hand, if she knows what
she wants to do with her life—especially if she
has already reached some of her goals—that
can make her very attractive.
—Damien

’’

“I’d be interested in a girl who can express herself in
an honest, respectful way and who doesn’t just agree with
everything I say. Even if she’s pretty, I don’t feel comfortable
with a girl who just says what I want to hear.”—Darren.

? Develop respect for others. Just as you have a need
for love, the boys you know have a deep desire for respect. It’s no coincidence that the Bible says to the husband
that he should love his wife but that the wife should have
“deep respect” for her husband. (Ephesians 5:33) In harmony with this insight, one survey of hundreds of young
men found that more than 60 percent said that they valued
respect more than love. Over 70 percent of the older men
surveyed made that same choice.
Respect doesn’t mean surrender—that you must give
up your right to hold a di?erent opinion and to express it.
(Genesis 21:10-12) But the way you express your opinion
will likely determine if you attract or repel a young man. If
you consistently contradict or correct what he says, he may
feel that you have little respect for him. Yet, if you acknowledge his viewpoint and comment on what you ?nd praiseworthy, he will be more likely to accept and value your opin190 young people ask

? Don’t be clingy. When a couple marry, they become
what the Bible calls “one ?esh.” (Genesis 2:24) At that stage
of the relationship, both husband and wife give up many of
the freedoms they may have had when single; really, they
become committed to each other. (1 Corinthians 7:32-34)
However, if you’re just getting to know a young man, you
don’t have the right to expect that level of accountability
from him, nor he from you.1 The fact is, when you recognize
his right to enjoy other friends, he may become more intrigued by you. And the way he uses that freedom will tell
you much about his character.—Proverbs 20:11.

Appreciate Your Own Value
You likely know girls who would do anything just to gain
the attention and approval of a boy. Others may lower their
standards just so they can have a boyfriend—or even a
husband. However, the principle ‘you reap what you sow’
applies in this matter. (Galatians 6:7-9) If you don’t value
yourself and the standards you try to live by, you’re likely to
attract boys who don’t value you or your standards either.
The fact is, not all boys will like you—and that can be a
good thing! But if you are conscious of caring for both your
outer beauty and your inner beauty, you will have “great
value in the eyes of God”—and you will attract the type of
young man that will suit you best.—1 Peter 3:4.

YOU’RE old enough to date. You’d like to ?nd someone
who is attractive and who shares your religious beliefs.
(1 Corinthians 7:39) In the past, though, each time you
tried to start a relationship, you felt as though you crashed
and burned. What went wrong? Are girls looking only
for the best-looking boys? “Some muscles on him can’t
hurt,” admits a girl named Lisa. Still, most girls are looking
for something more. “The good-looking boys don’t always
have substance,” says 18-year-old Carrie.
What’s involved in having “substance”? If you’d like to
get to know a girl better, what factors do you need to consider? And what Bible principles would you do well to remember?
What to Do First
Before you decide to pursue your interest in a particular girl, there are some basic skills you need to master, and
these will help you to be friends with anyone. Consider the
following.
? Cultivate good manners. The Bible says that “love
is not ill-mannered.” (1 Corinthians 13:5, Today’s English
Version) Good manners show that you respect others and
that you’re developing a mature, Christlike personality.
However, good manners aren’t like a suit you wear to impress others but take o? when you get home. Ask yourself, ‘Do I display good manDID YOU KNOW . . .

’’

? Maintain your personal hygiene. Good hygiene
shows respect not only for others but also for yourself.
(Matthew 7:12) If you respect yourself, others are more
likely to respect you. On the other hand, if you let your hygiene slide, you’ll sabotage your e?orts to impress a girl.
What girls say: “One boy who was interested in me
had really bad breath. I just couldn’t get past that.”—Kelly.
? Cultivate conversation skills. The basis of a lasting
relationship is good communication. You discuss not only
your interests but also the interests of your friend. (Philippians 2:3, 4) You really listen to what she has to say and
you value her opinions.
What girls say: “I’m impressed when a boy can converse with me naturally—when he can remember things I
told him and can ask questions that keep the conversation
moving.”—Christine.
“I think that boys are attracted to what they see, but
girls are more attracted to what they hear.”—Laura.
“Gifts are great. But if a boy can hold a good conversation, if he can comfort and encourage you with his words
. . . Wow! That’s attractive.”—Amy.
“I know one young man who is polite and never overly
familiar. We can actually have meaningful conversations
without his saying things like, ‘You smell really good’ or
‘You look very cute today.’ He really listens to what I say,
and that would make any girl feel good.”—Beth.

if he had a sense of humor but could also talk about more
serious things without sounding fake.”—Kelly.
? Be responsible. The Bible says: “We each must carry our own load.” (Galatians 6:5, Contemporary English
Version) Girls won’t be attracted to a young man who can’t
hold down a job because he is lazy or because he spends
too much time at play.
What girls say: “I wish some boys would take on more
responsibility. It’s a de?nite turn-o? when they don’t. It
doesn’t give a good impression.”—Carrie.
“Some boys don’t have their goals straight. If they’re interested in a girl, they ?nd out what her goals are and they

What girls say: “I can’t read minds. So if someone
wanted to get to know me better, he would have to be honest and straightforward and just tell me.”—Nina.
“It could be an awkward transition if you’ve been
friends for a while. But I’d respect someone if he simply
said that he would like to get to know me as more than just
a friend.”—Helen.
? Respect the girl’s decision. What if your friend says
that she doesn’t want a more serious relationship with
you? Dignify her by believing that she knows her own
heart and that her no means no. It betrays a lack of maturity if you make a pest of yourself. Really, if you ignore a
girl’s explicit rejection of your attention—even becoming
provoked by her rebu?—are you really thinking of her interests or your own?—1Corinthians 13:11.
What girls say: “It irritates me when I say a de?nite no
to a boy but he keeps on trying.”—Colleen.
“I explained to one boy that I wasn’t interested in him,
but he kept pressuring me for my phone number. I wanted to be nice. After all, it probably wasn’t easy for him to

had to be very ?rm with him.”—Sarah.
What Not to Do
Some young men feel that they have little trouble getting girls to like them. They may even compete with their
peers to show who can grab the attention of the most
girls. However, such competition is cruel and will earn you
a bad reputation. (Proverbs 20:11) You can avoid that outcome if you keep the following in mind.

poor friends and worse marriage mates. Discerning girls

of the same sex. Why? Consider: If you remarked that a
male friend looked good in his new suit or you regularly
talked to that friend and con?ded in him, it is unlikely that

that they can’t treat girls the same way that they treat their

? What did you think of the opposite sex when you were

? What do you think of the opposite sex now?
Your answerslikely reveal that when you hit puberty, you
gained a new appreciation for the opposite sex. “I’ve noticed
that girls are a little prettier than they used to be,” says 12year-old Brian. Elaine, 16, recalls a change that took place
a few years ago. “All my girlfriends started talking about
boys,” she says, “and for me, every boy was a potential
crush.”
Now that you’re noticing the opposite sex, how can you
cope with these powerful feelings? Instead of pretending
that they don’t exist—a sure?re way to intensify them—you
can use this as a wonderful opportunity to learn something
about attraction, infatuation, and love. Understanding these
three facets of romance can spare you needless heartache
and help you, in time, to ?nd real love.

cause looks can be deceiving. The Bible states: “As a gold
nose ring in the snout of a pig, so is a woman that is pretty
but that is turning away from sensibleness.” (Proverbs 11:
22) Of course, the same principle applies to boys.

INFATUATION @ What you feel

my friends were interested in boys—and he was a boy. So

LOVE @ What you know
“I think that with love, you have a reason to be attracted
to someone, and it’s a good reason—not a sel?sh one.”
—David.
“To me, it seems that real love should grow over time. At
?rst, you’re good friends. Then, little by little, you like what
you have come to know about the person, and you start to
develop feelings that you’ve never had before.”—Judith.
Love is based on a well-rounded knowledge of a person’s
strengths and weaknesses. It’s hardly surprising, then, that
the Bible describes love as much more than a feeling. It
states that love is, among other things, “long-su?ering and
kind. . . . It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all
things, endures all things. Love never fails.” (1 Corinthians
13:4, 7, 8) And love makes a person act in these ways based
on knowledge—not on credulity or ignorance.
An Example of Real Love
The Bible account of Jacob and Rachel vividly illustrates
real love. The couple met at a well, where Rachel had gone
to water her father’s sheep. Jacob was immediately attracted to her. Why? For one thing, she was “shapely and beautiful.”—Genesis 29:17, Today’s English Version.

Love can overcome obstacles, whereas infatuation tends to end as soon as circumstances
change or problems arise. It takes a lot of time
—Daniella
to cultivate real love.

’’

Remember, though, that real love is based on more than
physical appearance. Jacob found that there was more to
Rachel than her beauty. In fact, the Bible says that before
long, Jacob was beyond the stage of attraction. He was “in
love with Rachel.”—Genesis 29:18.
Romantic ending? No—because the story was far from
over. Rachel’s father made Jacob wait seven years before
he could marry Rachel. Fair or unfair, Jacob’s love was now
put to the test. If it were a case of mere infatuation, Jacob
would not have waited for her. Only real love can endure
the test of time. So what happened? The Bible states: “Jacob proceeded to serve seven years for Rachel, but in his
eyes they proved to be like some few days because of his
love for her.”—Genesis 29:20.

based solely on physical appearance. In fact, a potential
marriage mate may not be someone you ?nd overwhelmingly attractive at ?rst sight. Barbara, for example, met a
young man to whom she admits she was not overly attracted—at ?rst. “But as I got to know him better,” she recalls,
“things changed. I saw Stephen’s concern for other people
and how he always put the interests of others before himself. These were the qualities I knew would make a good
husband. I was drawn to him and began to love him.” A solid marriage resulted.
When you’re mature enough to date with a view to marriage, how will you know when you’ve found real love? Your
heart may speak, but trust your Bible-trained mind. Get to
know more than the person’s external image. Give the relationship time to blossom. Remember, infatuation often
fades within a short time. Genuine love grows stronger with
time and becomes “a perfect bond of union.”—Colossians
3:14.
Be assured that you can ?nd that kind of love—if you
learn to look beyond attraction (what you see) and infatuation (what you feel). The following three pages will help you
to do just that.

Ethan has been dating Alyssa for two months, and
he’s already noticed how contentious Alyssa can be, especially with her parents. In fact, Alyssa argues with her
parents constantly, and she usually wins. She’s mastered
the “art” of holding her position until her parents back
down in exhaustion. Alyssa has bragged to Ethan that she
has her parents “wrapped around her ?nger.”
He says: “Alyssa speaks her mind. She doesn’t take
anything from anyone—including her parents. Her dad can
be annoying, and it’s no wonder that she loses her temper
with him. But it’s not all yelling. Alyssa can cry, pout, or
act all sweet—whatever it takes to get what she wants
from Dad and Mom.”
She says: “I don’t care who you are or what title or position you hold, I’ll talk straight to you, and I may not
sugarcoat my words. My boyfriend, Ethan, knows that

30
You’ve found your
match, and you’ve been
dating long enough to
know that you’re in love.
Wedded bliss is on the
horizon. Or is it? On the
threshold of one of life’s
biggest decisions, you
start to wonder . . .

Are we
really
ready for
marriage?
NAGGING doubts about marriage are normal—even when
you’re in love. With unhappy
marriages abounding and divorce rates soaring, it’s under-

standable that you want to proceed with caution as you
contemplate this life-altering step. How do you know if
you’re ready for it? Now more than ever, you need to root
out any daydreams you may have about marriage and replace them with realities. For example:
DAYDREAM 1 “We can live on love.”
?
Reality: Love will neither pay bills nor cover over ?nancial hardship. In fact, researchers have found money to be
a leading cause of marital disputes and eventual divorce.
An unbalanced view of money can cause you spiritual and
emotional harm, and it can erode your relationship with
your spouse. (1 Timothy 6:9, 10) The lesson? Don’t wait
until after marriage to discuss money management!
The Bible says: “Who of you that wants to build a tower
does not ?rst sit down and calculate the expense?”—Luke
14:28.
Suggestion: Talk over your future ?nancial arrangements with your intended spouse now—before you are
married. (Proverbs 13:10) Consider such questions as
these: How will our income be budgeted? Will we have a
joint bank account or separate accounts? Which spouse
will be more adept at keeping ?nancial records and seeing
that bills are paid?1 How much money can one of us spend
on a purchase without consulting the other? Now is the
time to start working as a team!—Ecclesiastes 4:9, 10.
DAYDREAM 2 “We’ll be a perfect match as a married cou?
ple because we see eye to eye on everything—we never
disagree!”
Reality: If you never disagree, it’s probably because
you’ve carefully managed to avoid issues that might spark a
1 The “capable wife” of Proverbs 31:10-28 is portrayed as handling a number of
weighty responsibilities that had a direct bearing on family ?nances. See verses13,

con?ict. But marriage will not a?ord you that luxury! The
fact is, no two imperfect humans are perfectly matched, so
a measure of disagreement is inevitable. (Romans 3:23;
James 3:2) You need to consider not only how well you
agree but also what happens when you disagree. A strong
union is made up of two people who can openly acknowledge a di?erence and then work to settle the matter maturely and amicably.
The Bible says: “Don’t go to bed angry.”—Ephesians
4:26, Contemporary English Version.
Suggestion: Re?ect carefully on how you’ve handled
con?ict with your parents and siblings up to this point.
Make a chart similar to the one that appears on page 93 of
this book or on page 221 of Volume 2. Note speci?c events
that have triggered a disagreement, how you responded,
and what response might have been better. For example, if
your impulsive reaction to a con?ict has been to storm o?

ROLE MODEL

Ruth
The widow Ruth knows about loyalty. She has chosen
to stay by the side of her aged mother-in-law, Naomi, rather than return to a more comfortable life in her hometown.
Even though this choice lessens her chances of ?nding a
mate, Ruth keeps focused on the big picture. Her love for
Naomi and her desire to be with Jehovah’s people mean
more to her than impulsively satisfying her desire for marriage.—Ruth 1:8-17.
Are you thinking about marriage? Then imitate Ruth.
Look beyond your emotions, and ask what positive qualities you would bring to a future mate. For example, are you
loyal and self-sacri?cing? Do you conform to Godly principles, even when your imperfect ?esh begs you to do otherwise? Ruth did not desperately seek a mate. However,
in time, she found a husband who proved to be a mature
man who shared similar qualities—above all, a love for
God. The same outcome could be true for you.

° After you are married, will both you and your spouse
need to work? If so, how will you handle di?ering
schedules and transportation needs?—Proverbs15:22.
° Where will you and your spouse live? How much will
rent, food, clothing, and other expenseslikely cost, and
how will you pay for those expenses?—Proverbs 24:27.

demand.’ Remember, your spouse is a human being who
has feelings that must be considered. Frankly, there will be
times when your mate simply isn’t in the mood for intimacy. Marriage does not give you the right to insist on having
your needs ful?lled. (1Corinthians 10:24) The fact is, selfcontrol is vital in both singleness and marriage.—Galatians
5:22, 23.
The Bible says: “Each one of you should know how to
get possession of his own vessel in sancti?cation and honor, not in covetous sexual appetite.”—1 Thessalonians 4:
4, 5.
Suggestion: Make a careful review of your sexual desires and tendencies, and think about how these might affect your future marriage. For example, are you enslaved to
the self-focused habit of masturbation? Have you had a
habit of viewing pornography? Do you have a roving eye,
secretly looking lustfully at members of the opposite sex?
Ask yourself, ‘If I have trouble controlling my sexual desires before marriage, how will I be able to do so afterward?’ (Matthew 5:27, 28) Another matter: Have you been
prone to ?irt and play the ?eld, earning a reputation as a
playboy or a ?irt among those of the opposite sex? If so,

How can I get
over a breakup?
“We’d been dating for six months and had been

A BREAKUP can crush your joyful disposition and replace
it with tearful despair. Consider Je? and Susan, who dated
for two years. Over that period their emotional bond grew.
Throughout the day, Je? sent Susan text messages with
expressions of endearment. From time to time, he gave her
gifts to show that he was thinking of her. “Je? put forth an
e?ort to listen to me and understand me,” Susan says. “He
made me feel special.”
Before long, Je? and Susan were talking about marriage and where they would live as husband and wife. Je?
even inquired about Susan’s ring size. Then, quite suddenly, he called o? the relationship! Susan was devastated. She
went through the motions of daily life, but she felt numb
with shock. “I became mentally and physically exhausted,”
she says.1
Why It Hurts
If you’ve been in a situation similar to that of Susan, you
might well wonder, ‘Will I ever be able to move on?’ Your
distress is understandable. “Love is as powerful as death,”
wrote King Solomon. (Song of Solomon 8:6, Today’s English Version) So, breaking up may be one of the most traumatic experiences you’ve ever had to endure. In fact, some
have said that a breakup is like a minideath. You may even

stages of grief:

Each year, millions of people are raped or otherwise
sexually abused, and research shows that young people
are a prime target. For example, it’s estimated that in
the United States, about half of all rape victims are under
18 years of age. Because of the prevalence of abuse,
it is vital that you consider this topic.

How can I protect
myself from sexual
predators?
“He grabbed me and threw me down before I knew
what was happening. I tried everything I could to
?ght him o?. I pulled out a can of pepper spray, but
he knocked it away. I tried to scream, but only air
escaped my lungs. I pushed, kicked, punched, and
scratched. And that’s when I felt a knife pierce my
skin. I went completely limp.”—Annette.

SEXUAL predators run rampant today, and young people
are often the target of their attack. Some youths, like Annette, are assaulted by a stranger. Others are attacked by a
neighbor. Such was the case with Natalie, who at just 10
years of age was sexually abused by a teenager who lived
near her home. “I was so scared and ashamed that at ?rst I
didn’t tell anyone,” she says.
Many youths have been molested by a family member.
“Between the ages of 5 and 12, I was sexually abused by my
228 young people ask

father,” says a woman named Carmen. “I ?nally confronted
him about it when I was 20. He said he was sorry, but a few
months later, he kicked me out of the house.”
Sexual abuse at the hands of a neighbor, friend, or family member is disturbingly common today.1 But the exploitation of young people is nothing new. Such deplorable
conduct took place even in the days when the Bible was
written. (Joel 3:3; Matthew 2:16) Today we live in critical
times. Many people lack “natural a?ection,” and it’s common for girls (and even boys) to be taken advantage of sexually. (2 Timothy 3:1-3) While no precaution guarantees
your safety, there is much you can do to protect yourself.
Consider the following tips:
Be alert. As you walk outdoors, know what is happening ahead of you, behind you, and on both sides. Some
areas are known to be dangerous, especially at night. To the
extent possible, either avoid those areas or at least make
sure you’re not alone.—Proverbs 27:12.
Don’t send mixed messages. Avoid ?irting or dressing provocatively. Such actions may send the message that
you’re interested in getting physical—or at least that you
wouldn’t object to it.—1 Timothy 2:9, 10.
Talk about boundaries. If you’re dating, discuss with
the other person what conduct is and is not appropriate.2
Once you have set boundaries, do not put yourself in compromising situations in which you could be abused.—Proverbs 13:10.
Be willing to speak up. There’s nothing wrong with
?rmly stating, “Don’t do that!” or “Take your hand o? me!”
Don’t hold back out of fear that you’ll lose your boyfriend. If

How can I protect myself from sexual predators? 229

“if you love me . . . ”
One type of sexual predator doesn’t force himself on
girls but cleverly plays on their emotions. How? By saying
such things as, “Everyone else has sex,” “No one will ever
?nd out,” or, as mentioned in Chapter 24 of this book, “If
you love me, you’ll do this.” Don’t be conned by a boy who
tries to make you believe that sex equals love. The fact is,
anyone who thinks that way is only looking out for his own
grati?cation. He is not thinking of you or your welfare. In
contrast, a real man will put your interests above his own
and will show that he has the strength to uphold God’s

attack. (Proverbs 22:3) Realistically, though, you may not
always be in full control of your circumstances. For instance, you might not always be able to have a traveling
companion or to avoid dangerous areas. You may even live
in a dangerous area.
Perhaps you know through bitter experience that bad
things can happen despite your e?orts to avoid trouble.
Like Annette, quoted at the outset, you may have been
caught unawares and been overpowered. Or like Carmen,
you may have been victimized as a child and, as such, were
powerless to control the situation—or even to understand
fully what was happening. How can you deal with the guilt
that often torments those who have been sexually abused?
Coping With Guilt
Annette still struggles with
guilt over what occurred. “I’m
my own worst enemy,” she
says. “I keep playing that night
over and over again in my
head. I feel as though I should
have tried harder to ?ght him
o?. The fact is, after being
stabbed, I was paralyzed with
fear. I couldn’t do anything
more, but I feel that I should
have.”

TIP



If you have been the
victim of sexual abuse,
keep a list of scriptures
that can comfort you.
These might include
Psalm 37:28; 46:1; 118:
5-9; Proverbs 17:17; and
Philippians 4:6, 7.

How can I protect myself from sexual predators? 231

It’s very hard to speak up about the abuse,
but it’s the best thing you can do. Speaking
up helps you to let go of your sadness and

anger and to regain your power.

’’

Natalie also struggles with guilt. “I shouldn’t have been
so trusting,” she says. “My parents had a rule that my sister and I had to stay together when we played outside, but
I didn’t listen. So I feel I gave my neighbor the opportunity
to hurt me. What happened a?ected my family, and I feel
responsible for causing them so much pain. I struggle with
that the most.”
If your feelings are similar to those of Annette or Natalie, how can you cope with guilt? First, try to keep foremost
in mind that if you were raped, you were not a willing participant. Some people trivialize the issue, using the excuse
that “boys will be boys” and that victims of rape were asking
for it. But no one deserves to be raped. If you were the victim of such a heinous act, you are not to blame!
Of course, reading the statement “you are not to blame”
is easy; believing it may be much more di?cult. Some keep
what happened bottled up inside and are racked with guilt
and other negative emotions. However, who is best served
by silence—you or the abuser? You owe it to yourself to
consider another option.
Telling Your Story
The Bible tells us that in the height of his personal turmoil, the righteous man Job said: “I will give vent to my
concern about myself. I will speak in the bitterness of my
soul!” (Job 10:1) You will bene?t from doing the same. Talking to a trusted con?dant about what happened can in time

help you to come to terms with the rape and gain relief from
your distressing emotions.
In fact, if you are a Christian, it is important that you
speak to a congregation elder about what happened. The
comforting words of a loving shepherd can assure you that
as a victim of rape, you have not been de?led by someone
else’s sin. That’s what Annette found. She says: “I talked
to a close friend, and she urged
me to speak with a couple of
Christian elders in my congregation. I’m glad I did. They sat
down with me on several occasions and told me exactly what
I needed to hear—that what
happened was not my fault.

Talking about what happened and expressing your feelings can keep you from becoming consumed with anger
and resentment. (Psalm 37:8) It may also help you to gain
relief, perhaps for the ?rst time in years. After she told her
parents about the abuse, Natalie found that to be true.
“They supported me,” she says. “They encouraged me to
talk about it, and that helped me not to be so sad and angry
inside.” Natalie also found comfort in prayer. “Talking to
God helped me,” she says, “especially at those times when
I felt that I couldn’t open up to another human. When I
pray, I can speak freely. It gives me a real sense of peace
and calm.”1
You too can ?nd that there is “a time to heal.” (Ecclesiastes 3:3) Rely on supportive friends who are like the elders described as being similar to “a hiding place from the
wind and a place of concealment from the rainstorm.” (Isaiah 32:2) Take care of yourself physically and emotionally. Get needed rest. And most of all, rely on the God
of all comfort, Jehovah, who will soon bring about a new
world in which “evildoers themselves will be cut o?, but
those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the
earth.”—Psalm 37:9.
1 Sometimes victims of abuse are subject to severe depression. In such a case, it
might be wise to consult a physician. For more information on coping with distressing feelings, see Chapters13 and 14 of this book.

IF YOU checked any of the boxes on page 237, then you
have something in common with your peers who smoke tobacco or have thought about it.1 For example:
Satisfying curiosity. “I wondered what it was like, so I
took a cigarette from a girl at school and then sneaked out

Coping with stress and ?tting in. “Kids at school would

But before you light your ?rst—or your next—cigarette,

themselves of “every de?lement of ?esh.” (2 Corinthians
7:1) There is no doubt that smoking de?les the body. If you
choose to be unclean, harming yourself and others by using
tobacco, you cannot be a friend of God.—Matthew 22:39;
Galatians 5:19-21.

How to Resist
So, what will you do if someone o?ers you a cigarette?
A simple but ?rm response, such as “No thanks, I don’t
smoke,” will often work. If the person persists or even taunts
you, remember that it is your choice. You might say:
? “I checked out the risks and decided that it’s not for
me.”
? “I have some important future plans that involve
breathing.”
? “Are you denying my right to make a personal choice?”
Like the youths quoted earlier in this chapter, though,
you may ?nd that the greatest pressure comes from inside
yourself. If that’s the case, answer this ‘inner voice’ by reasoning on questions such as these:
? ‘Will I really gain bene?ts from smoking? For instance,
if I decide to smoke just to be accepted by others, will I
somehow ?t in despite having little else in common with
them? Do I even want to ?t in with people who would be
happy to see me damage my own health?’
? ‘How much will smoking cost me in money, health
problems, and loss of others’ respect?’
? ‘Would I be willing to sell out my friendship with God
for the price of a cigarette?’

is marijuana really that bad?
“Some say that using marijuana is a
way to escape problems,” says Ellen, who
lives in Ireland, “and that it doesn’t have any
bad side e?ects.” Have you heard similar
statements about marijuana? Compare some
common myths with the facts.
Myth. Marijuana is not harmful.
Fact. Known or suspected lasting e?ects of
marijuana are as follows: damaged memory, impaired
ability to learn, and suppressed immune system, as
well as damage to the sexual health of both males and
females. It can induce anxiety attacks, psychoses, and
paranoia. Children born to women who smoke marijuana
are more likely to have behavioral problems, be less
attentive, and have greater di?culty making decisions.
Myth. Marijuana smoke is less harmful than cigarette
smoke.
Fact. Compared with tobacco smoke, marijuana
smoke can deposit four times as much tar on your
airways and carry ?ve times as much poisonous carbon
monoxide into your blood. Smoking ?ve marijuana
joints can deliver the same amount of cancer-causing
toxins as an entire pack of cigarettes.
Myth. Marijuana is not addictive.
Fact. Teens who have mental or emotional problems
can quickly become addicted to marijuana. Others can
become addicted after long-term use. In addition, studies
show that teens who smoke marijuana have a much
greater risk of using other addictive drugs, such as
cocaine.

How to Quit
1. Be Convinced. Write

and review this list regularly.
A desire to be clean before God
can be a powerful motive.—Romans 12:1; Ephesians 4:
17-19.
2. Get help. If you’ve been smoking in secret, now is the
time to come clean. Tell those you have been hiding your
smoking from that you are quitting, and ask for their support. If you want to serve God, pray for his help.—1 John
5:14.
3. Set a quit date. Give yourself two weeks or less, and
mark on your calendar the day you are determined to quit.
Tell your family and friends that you are quitting on that
date.
4. Search and destroy. Before you reach your quit date,
scour your room, car, and clothing for any cigarettes. Destroy them. Get rid of lighters, matches, and ashtrays.

Don’t Be Duped
Each year, tobacco companies spend billions of dollars
on advertising. Whom do they particularly target? An internal tobacco company document states: “Today’s teenager is
tomorrow’s potential regular customer.”
Don’t allow tobacco executives to get their hands into
your pockets. Why take their bait? Neither that group nor
your peers who smoke have your best interests at heart.
Rather than listen to them, listen to the advice found in the
Bible and learn “to bene?t yourself.”—Isaiah 48:17.

WHAT is binge drinking? Some de?ne it as simply drinking
to get drunk. A report by the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism tried to be more speci?c. It said
that binge drinking is “typically de?ned as consuming ?ve or
more drinks in a row for men, and four or more drinks in a
row for women.”
If you have been tempted either to drink to excess or to
drink in spite of being under the legal age, you’re not alone.
Many youths abuse alcohol.1 But ask yourself, ‘What do I
really know about why I want to drink and what e?ects alcohol can have on me?’ For example, how would you answer
these true-or-false questions? Place a  in the box next to
your response, and then consider the facts.

e. Poor health is the only
consequence of binge drinking. O True O False

a. Teens drink only because they like the taste of alcohol. Answer—False. In an alcohol-awareness survey taken
in Australia, 36 percent of the young ones questioned said
that they drank primarily to ?t in at social activities. In the
United States, a survey found that 66 percent said that they
drank because of peer pressure. However, more than half
also said that they drank to try to forget problems.

b. Because they are younger and ?tter, teens face

Answer—False. “New research suggests that young drinkers are courting danger,” says an article in Discover magazine. Why? “Teens who drink excessively may be destroying
signi?cant amounts of mental capacity.”
Chronic alcohol consumption is also associated with increased acne, premature wrinkling of the skin, weight gain,
alcohol dependency, and drug addiction. It can also wreak
havoc on the nervous system, the liver, and the heart.
c. Binge drinking can’t kill you. Answer—False.
Excessive amounts of alcohol deprive the brain of oxygen;

Other painful consequences can include ruined friendships,
poor performance at school and work, a criminal record,

Most important, consider the spiritual damage overdrinking can cause. Jehovah God wants you to serve him
with “your whole mind”—not a mind needlessly damaged
by overindulgence in alcohol. (Matthew 22:37) God’s Word
condemns not only “excesses with wine” but also “drinking
matches.” (1 Peter 4:3) Therefore, engaging in binge drinking runs counter to the will of our Creator and will prevent
you from enjoying a close friendship with God.
What Choice Will You Make?
Will you simply follow your peers who abuse alcohol?
“Do you not know,” states the Bible, “that if you keep presenting yourselves to anyone as slaves to obey him, you are

What should you do if binge drinking has caught you in
its snare? Get help immediately by speaking to a parent or a
mature friend. Go to Jehovah God in prayer, and beg for his
help. After all, he is “a help that is readily to be found during
distresses.” (Psalm 46:1) Since binge drinking and underage
drinking often result from peer pressure, you may need to
make substantial changes in your choice of friends.1 Making
such changes won’t be easy, but with Jehovah’s help you
can succeed.

How can I break free
from drugs?
ARE YOU hooked on drugs? You may know that your addiction is damaging your mind and body. You may even
have tried to break the habit but then relapsed. If so, don’t
despair. Others have overcome drug addiction, and so can
you! For example, consider what three people from very different backgrounds say about how they broke free.
NAME

Marta

My mom wasn’t married when she gave
birth to me, so my sister and I were brought up without a father. From about age 12, I started going to discos with an
aunt who loved to dance. I was very outgoing and soon became involved with people who had bad habits. I began experimenting with drugs at the age of 13. I also started using
cocaine. At ?rst, I enjoyed using the drug. But after a while,
I began having hallucinations and became afraid of everything. And when the e?ects of the drugs wore o?, thoughts
of suicide ?lled my mind. I wanted to quit
drugs but didn’t have the willpower.
HOW I BROKE FREE I began thinking about
God and even attended church a few
times. But I only felt more despondent. At the age of 18, I went to
live with my boyfriend and had
a baby. Having a son increased
my desire to change my lifestyle.

become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and o?ered to study the
Bible with me. I accepted.
I learned that my lifestyle was not pleasing to God and
that I had to quit taking drugs and smoking. But the drugs
had a strong hold on me. I begged Jehovah God several
times a day to help me break free from my bad habits. I
wanted to please him. (Proverbs 27:11) After six months of
studying the Bible and associating with Jehovah’s Witnesses, I was able to quit drugs. Now my life is more meaningful. I’m no longer depressed all the time. I met a wonderful
Christian man and married him. I have raised my son according to Bible principles. I am so thankful that Jehovah

I soon knew I had to break

I also stopped associating with the people who encouraged
my bad habits. As I learned and applied the Bible’s teachings, I gained the emotional security I needed to overcome
some of my personality ?aws. My girlfriend also studied the

Am I addicted to

“I love, love, love texting! I think it’s the greatest
thing ever. I guess you could say that it has taken
over my life.”—Alan.

WHEN your parents entered their teens, TVand radio were
the main forms of electronic media. Back then, phones were
just phones—they carried only voice transmissions and had
to be connected to a wall outlet. Does that sound hopelessly old-fashioned? A girl named Anna would say so. “My
parents grew up in the technological dark ages,” she says.
“They’re just now ?guring out how to use some of the features on their cell phone!”

Today you can take a call, listen to music, watch a show,
play a game, e-mail your friends, take a picture, and access the Internet—all on a single device you can carry in
your pocket. Because you’ve grown up with computers, cell
phones, TV, and the Internet, you may think nothing of using them all the time. Your parents, though, may feel that
you’re addicted. If they express concern, don’t write o? their
comments as being out of touch with reality. “When anyone
is replying to a matter before he hears it,” said wise King Solomon, “that is foolishness on his part.”—Proverbs 18:13.

Why won’t my parents
let me have fun?
For Allison, a teenager in Australia, Monday
morning at school is as stressful as it is predictable.
“Everyone talks about what they did on the weekend,” she says. “They tell stories that sound so
exciting, like about how many parties they went to
and how many boys they kissed—even about running
away from the police . . . It sounds so scary, but fun!
They come home at ?ve o’clock in the morning, and
their parents don’t care. I have to be in bed before
they even start their night!
“Anyway, after telling me their weekend action
stories, my classmates ask me what I did. . . . I went
to Christian meetings. I engaged in the ministry. I
feel like I really missed out on a good time. So I usually just tell them that I did nothing. Then they ask
why I didn’t come with them.
“Once Mondays are over, you’d think it would be
easier. But it’s not. By Tuesday, everyone is talking
about the upcoming weekend! I usually sit and just
listen to them talk. I feel so left out!”

IS YOUR Monday morning at school similar? You might
feel that there’s a world of fun outside your door but that
your parents have locked it tight—or as if you’re at an
amusement park but you’re not allowed to get on any of the
rides. It’s not that you want to do everything your peers do.

You need recreation. In fact, your Creator wants you to
enjoy your youth. (Ecclesiastes 3:1, 4) And although you
may doubt it at times, your parents also want you to have
fun. Likely, however, your parents will have two legitimate
concerns: (1) what you will do and (2) who will accompany
you.
What, though, if you’re invited to go out with friends but
you aren’t sure how your parents will react? Consider three
options and their consequences.

OPTION B DON’T ASK—DON’T GO

Why you might consider this option: You think about

the other hand, you might want to go but don’t have the
courage to ask your parents.
The consequences: If you don’t go because you know
it’s a bad idea, you’ll be more con?dent when answering

I was so dumb when I was younger. Some of

’’

The consequences: Your parents feel that you love and
respect them. And if they view your request as reasonable,
they might say yes.
Why Parents Might Say No
What, though, if your parents say no? That can be frustrating. However, understanding their point of view may
help you cope with the restrictions. For example, they
might say no for one or more of the following reasons.
Greater knowledge and experience. If you had a
choice, likely you would prefer to swim at a beach that is
manned by lifeguards. Why? Because while you’re in the
water having fun, your awareness of danger is very limited.
But the lifeguards have a better vantage point from which
to spot hazards.
Similarly, because of their greater knowledge and experience, your parents may be aware of dangers that you do
not see. Like the lifeguards on the beach, your parents’ goal
is, not to spoil your fun, but to help you avoid dangers that
could rob you of enjoyment in life.
Love for you. Your parents have a strong desire to protect you. Love moves them to say yes when they can but no
when they have to. When you ask their permission to do
something, they ask themselves if they can grant the request and then live with the consequences. They will say
yes to themselves—and to you—only if they are reasonably convinced that no harm will come to you.

How to Improve Your Chances of Getting a Yes
Four factors come into play.
Honesty: First, you need to ask yourself honestly: ‘Why
do I really want to go? Is it primarily the activity that I enjoy,
or is it that I want to ?t in with my peers? Is it because
someone that I’m attracted to will be there?’ Then be honest with your parents. They were young once, and they
know you well. So they will likely discern your real motives
anyhow. They’ll appreciate your candor, and you’ll bene?t
from their wisdom. (Proverbs 7:1, 2) On the other hand, if
you’re not honest, you undermine your credibility and lessen the chances that you’ll hear a yes.

Timing: Don’t pummel your parents with requests
when they have just arrived home from work or when they
are concentrating on other matters. Approach them when
they are more relaxed. But don’t wait until the last minute
and then try to pressure them for an answer. Your parents
will not appreciate having to make a rushed decision. Ask
early, giving them time to think, and your parents will appreciate your consideration.
Content: Don’t be vague. Explain exactly what you
want to do. Parents feel uncomfortable with the answer “I
don’t know,” especially when they’ve asked you: “Who will
be there?” “Will a responsible adult be present?” or “When
will the event end?”
Attitude: Don’t view your parents as enemies. View
them as part of your team—because, all things considered,
they are. If you view your parents as allies, you’re less likely to sound combative and they are more likely to be cooperative. Avoid such statements as “You don’t trust me,”
“Everybody else is going,” or “My friends’ parents are letting
them go!” Show your parents that you’re mature enough to
accept their decision and respect it. If you do, they will respect you. And next time, they may be more inclined to
look for ways to say yes.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

? Why might you be reluctant to give your
parents all the information they need in order
to make a decision?

getting a yes from your parents by withholding
vital facts?

How can I make
worship of God
enjoyable?
Josh, 16, is sprawled on his bed. His mom stands
at the doorway. “Joshua, get up!” she says sternly.
“You know it’s a meeting night!” Josh is being raised
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and attendance at
Christian meetings is a part of the family routine.
Lately, though, Josh hasn’t felt inclined to attend.
“Oh, Mom,” he groans, “do I really have to go?”
“Stop complaining and get dressed,” she replies.
“I don’t want to be late again!” She turns and starts
to walk away.
“Look, Mom,” Josh blurts out while she’s still
within earshot. “This may be your religion, but
that doesn’t mean it’s mine.” He knows his
mom heard that because the sound of her
footsteps has stopped. Then, without
responding, she continues walking away.
Josh feels a twinge of guilt. He doesn’t
really want to hurt his mom. But he
doesn’t want to apologize either. The
only thing he can do is . . .
With a sigh, Josh starts getting dressed.
Then he says, more to himself than to his
mom: “Sooner or later I’m going to have
to make my own decision. I’m not like the
others at the Kingdom Hall. I’m just not
cut out to be a Christian!”

273

HAVE you ever felt the way Josh does in the preceding
scenario? At times, does it seem that while others enjoy
Christian activities, you’re just going through the motions?
For instance:
? Is studying the Bible just like another homework assignment to you?
? Do you dislike taking part in the door-to-door ministry?
? Do you often ?nd yourself getting bored at Christian
meetings?
If your answer is yes, don’t be discouraged. You can
learn to enjoy serving God. Let’s see how.
CHALLENGE 1 Studying the Bible
?

Why it’s not easy. Maybe you feel you’re just not the
“studying type.” Your attention span seems short—it’s
hard to sit still and concentrate! Besides, don’t you have
enough studying to do for school?
Why you should do it. Not only is the Bible inspired of
God but it’s also “useful for teaching and helping people
and for correcting them and showing them how to live.”
(2 Timothy 3:16, Contemporary English Version) Studying
the Bible and meditating on what you read can open up a
whole new world for you. Let’s face it, nothing worthwhile
comes to you without some hard work. If you
want to play a sport well, you’ve got to learn
the rules and practice the game. If you want
to get ?t, you need to exercise. Likewise, if
you want to learn about your Creator, you
need to study God’s Word.

?

Why it’s not easy. After sitting in class all day, an hour

Psalm 34:8, which says: “Taste and see that Jehovah is
good.” How satisfying is it just to hear about a mouthwatering dish? Isn’t it better to savor the food for yourself? It’s
the same with worshipping God. Taste and see for yourself
how rewarding it is to participate in spiritual activities. The
Bible says that the one who is not just a hearer but a
doer of the work “will be happy in his doing it.”—James

they set goals
The Bible states: “You do not know what your life will
be tomorrow.” (James 4:14) In some cases, death comes
unexpectedly and at a young age. As you read the experiences of Catrina and Kyle, note how they made a good
name with Jehovah God during their brief lives by setting
and reaching spiritual goals.—Ecclesiastes 7:1.
Catrina passed away at the age of 18, but at 13 she
had already written out a “life plan”—a list of goals she
wanted to achieve. Her goals included entering the fulltime ministry, serving in a land where there is a need for
Bible teachers, and working along with her dad on Kingdom Hall construction projects. She wrote: “I have made
a dedication of my life to Jehovah God!” Catrina’s aim was
to “live according to his standards, in a way that makes
him happy.” At her funeral, Catrina was described as a
“beautiful young woman who had her whole life planned
out to be centered around Jehovah.”

From an early age, Kyle was taught to have goals. After
a tragic car accident claimed his life at age 20, his relatives found a “goal book” that his mom helped him make
when he was just four years old. His goals included getting
baptized, giving talks at the Kingdom Hall, and serving at
the headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses, where he could
assist in producing literature that would help people to
learn about God. After looking through Kyle’s goal book,
made so many years earlier, his mother stated, “He
reached every one of those goals.”
What goals have you set for yourself? You do not know
what your life will hold tomorrow. So, use each day you
have to the full. Like Catrina and Kyle, spend your time in
the most rewarding way possible. Imitate the apostle

How can I reach
my goals?
Which of the following
would you like to have?
i O More con?dence
O More friends
O More happiness

ACTUALLY, you can
have all three! How?
By setting and reaching
goals. Consider the following:
More con?dence. When you set small goals and reach
them, you’ll have the con?dence to take on bigger ones.
You’ll also feel more con?dent when facing day-to-day challenges—such as standing up to peer pressure.
More friends. People enjoy being around those who
are reasonably goal-oriented—those who know what they
want and who are willing to work for it.
More happiness. Let’s face it: There’s little fun in being
bored or waiting for your life to happen. On the other hand,
when you set and reach goals, you feel a sense of accomplishment. Ready to get started? The following pages will

to start toward my goal?’ Granted, you may not have every
detail worked out, but don’t let that keep you from getting
started. As the Bible puts it, “if you wait until the wind and

Timothy
Timothy is about to leave home—not to run away
from his family but to become a missionary companion
of the apostle Paul! Possibly in his late teens, Timothy is
already a responsible young man who has been “well
reported on by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.” (Acts
16:2) Paul is con?dent that Timothy can accomplish great
things in God’s service. And he does! In the years that follow, Timothy travels extensively, establishing congregations and building up the brotherhood. Timothy’s ?ne qualities endear him to Paul, who some 11years later tells the
Philippians: “I have no one else of a disposition like his
who will genuinely care for the things pertaining to you.”
—Philippians 2:20.
Are you making yourself available to be used in God’s
service? If you are, great blessings await you! Jehovah
truly values young ones who “o?er themselves willingly.”
(Psalm 110:3) Furthermore, you can be assured that Jehovah God “is not unrighteous so as to forget your work.”
—Hebrews 6:10.

Is there really any harm in arguing
with either my spouse or my children?
In marriage, disagreements are inevitable. How you
handle them, though, is a matter of choice. Youths are profoundly a?ected by their parents’ arguments.
SEE VOLUME 1,
This is a matter of concern, since your marCHAPTER 2,
riage is, in e?ect, a model that your children
AND VOLUME 2,
CHAPTER 24
are likely to follow if they marry. Why not use
disagreements as an opportunity to demonstrate e?ective ways to resolve con?icts? Try the following:
Listen. The Bible tells us to be “swift about hearing,
slow about speaking, slow about wrath.” (James 1:19)
Don’t add fuel to the ?re by ‘returning evil for evil.’ (Romans
12:17) Even if your spouse seems unwilling to listen, you
can choose to do so.
Strive to explain rather than criticize. In a calm manner,
tell your spouse how his or her conduct has a?ected you.
(“I feel hurt when you . . .”) Resist the urge to accuse and
criticize. (“You don’t care about me.” “You never listen.”)
Take a time-out. Sometimes it is best to drop the matter and resume the discussion when tempers have cooled
down. The Bible says: “The beginning of contention is as
one letting out waters; so before the quarrel has burst
forth, take your leave.”—Proverbs 17:14.

Appendix 291

COMMUNICATION

Apologize to each other—and, if appropriate, to your
children. Brianne, 14, says: “Sometimes after they’ve argued, my parents will apologize to me and my older brother because they know how it a?ects us.” One of the most
valuable lessons you can teach your children is how to say
humbly, “I’m sorry.”
What, though, if the problem involves arguing with your
children? Consider if you are unwittingly adding fuel to the
?re. For instance, look at the scenario that opens Chapter 2
on page 15 of this volume. Can you identify some things
Rachel’s mom did that contributed to the argument? How
can you avoid arguing with your teen? Try the following:
? Avoid sweeping assertions, such as “You always . . .”
or “You never . . .” Such statements only invite a defensive
response. After all, they are likely to be exaggerations, and
your child knows it. Your child may also know that sweeping assertions are really more about your anger than his or
her irresponsibility.
? Rather than using blunt statements that begin with
the word “you,” try expressing how your child’s behavior affects you. For example, “I feel . . . when you . . .” Believe it
or not, deep down, your feelings are important to your teen.
By letting your teen know how you are a?ected, you are
more likely to elicit his or her cooperation.1
? Hard as it may be, hold back until your temper is in
check. (Proverbs 29:22) If the issue that is causing the argument involves chores, discuss it with your child. Write
down speci?cally what is required of him or her, and if necessary, make clear what the consequences will be if your
expectations are not met. Patiently listen to your child’s
point of view, even if you feel that view is incorrect. Most
teens respond better to a listening ear than to a lecture.

? Before hastily concluding that a spirit of rebellion has
taken control of your teen, realize that much of what you
observe is part of your child’s natural development. Your
child may argue a point just to prove that he is growing
up. Resist the urge to get involved in disputes. Remember,
how you respond to provocation teaches a lesson to your
teen. Set an example in patience and long-su?ering, and
your son or daughter will likely imitate you.—Galatians 5:
22, 23.

—something most parents desire.
Just how much should you tell your son or daughter
about your past? Naturally, you might prefer to withhold
embarrassing information. Yet, where appropriate, revealing some of your struggles can be helpful to your children.

How can I get my child to talk to me?
When they were little, your children probably talked to
you about everything. If you asked a question, they answered

is present with me. . . . Miserable man that I am!” (Romans
7:21-24) Jehovah God inspired those words to be recorded
and preserved in the Bible for our bene?t. And we do indeed bene?t, for who cannot relate to Paul’s candid expression?
Similarly, hearing about your good choices and your
mistakes can help your children relate to you better. Granted, you were raised in a di?erent era. However, while times
have changed, human nature has not; neither have Scriptural principles. (Psalm 119:144) Discussing challenges
you’ve faced—and how you overcame them—can help your
teenagers as they work through their problems. “When you
discover that your parents have faced challenges similar to
your own, it makes your parents seem a lot more real,” says
a young man named Cameron. He adds, “The next time
you have a problem, you wonder if your parents have been
through this before too.”
A caution: Not all stories necessarily need to end with
counsel. True, you might be concerned that your teen will
draw the wrong conclusion or even feel justi?ed in making similar mistakes himself. But instead of summarizing
what you want your child to take away from the discussion
(“That’s why you should never . . .”), brie?y state how you
feel. (“In hindsight, I wish I hadn’t done such-and-such because . . .”) Your son or daughter can thus learn a valuable
lesson from your experience without feeling as if he or she
has been given a lecture.—Ephesians 6:4.

COMMUNICATION

contrast, getting your teenagers to talk may seem as futile as
extracting water from a dry well. ‘They talk to their friends,’
you say to yourself. ‘Why won’t they talk to me?’
Don’t let their silence cause you to conclude that your
teenagers have rejected you or that they don’t want you to be
involved in their life. The fact is, they need you now more than
ever. And the good news is, research reveals that most teenagers still value the advice of their parents—even over that of
their peers or the media.
Then why are they so reluctant to tell you what’s on their
mind? Consider what some youths say about why they hold
back from talking to their parents. Then ask yourself the accompanying questions and look up the cited scriptures.
“I ?nd it hard to approach Dad because he has a lot
on his plate, both at work and in the congregation.
There never really seems to be a convenient time to
talk to him.”—Andrew.
‘Have I unwittingly sent the message that I’m too busy to
talk to my teenagers? If so, how can I make myself more approachable? When can I set aside some time regularly to talk
with my children?’—Deuteronomy 6:7.
“I approached my mother in tears about an argument I’d had at school. I wanted her to comfort me,
but instead she just reprimanded me. Since then,
I haven’t approached her about anything important.”
—Kenji.
‘How do I respond when my children approach me with a
problem? Even if correction is in order, can I learn to stop and
listen with empathy before giving advice?’—James 1:19.
“It seems that every time parents say we can talk
and they won’t get angry, they still become upset.
Then the teen feels betrayed.”—Rachel.

‘If my child tells me something that is upsetting, how can
I control my initial reaction?’—Proverbs 10:19.
“Many times when I opened up to Mom about very
private matters, she turned around and told them to
her friends. I lost con?dence in her for a long time.”
—Chantelle.
‘Do I show consideration for my child’s feelings by not
spreading private matters that he or she has con?ded to
me?’—Proverbs 25:9.
“I have a lot of things I want to talk about with my
parents. I just need their help to start the conversation.”—Courtney.
‘Can I take the initiative to talk to my adolescent? What
times are best for talking together?’—Ecclesiastes 3:7.
As a parent, you have everything to gain by building
bridges of communication between you and your child. Consider the experience of 17-year-old Junko in Japan. “One
time,” she says, “I admitted to my mother that I felt more at
ease with my schoolmates than with fellow Christians. The
next day, there was a letter from Mom on my desk. In the letter she told me how she too had felt the lack of friends among
fellow believers. She reminded me of individuals in the Bible
who served God even when there wasn’t anyone for them to
be with who would encourage them. She also commended
me for the e?orts I had made to cultivate wholesome friendships. I was surprised to learn that I was not the only one who
had faced this problem. My mother had too, and I was so happy to learn about it that I cried. I was very encouraged by what
my mother told me, and I was strengthened to do what was
right.”
As Junko’s mother found out, teenagers tend to open up
to parents when they are assured that their thoughts and feelings will not be met with ridicule or criticism. But what can you

COMMUNICATION

do if your teenager seems annoyed or even angry when he or
she speaks to you? Resist the urge to respond in kind. (Romans 12:21; 1 Peter 2:23) Instead, as hard as it may seem,
show by example the type of speech and behavior that you expect of your teenager.
Remember this: As they grow to adulthood, teenagers are
in a stage of transition. Experts have noted that during this
period, adolescents tend to ?uctuate in their behavior—on
one occasion acting older than their years and on another occasion acting more like a child. If you notice this with your
teenager, what can you do—especially on an occasion when
he or she acts younger than his or her years?
Resist the urge to lash out in criticism or get embroiled in
a childish dispute. Instead, appeal to your teenager as an
“adult in training.” (1 Corinthians 13:11) For example, if the
childish side of your teenager emerges and he or she says,
“Why are you always nagging me?” you might be tempted to
respond in anger. If you do so, however, you give up control of
the conversation, and you will likely become trapped in an argument. On the other hand, you could simply say: “It sounds
like you’re really upset. Why don’t we discuss this later after
you’ve cooled down?” That way, you stay in control. The stage
is now set for a conversation, rather than an argument.

Should I enforce a curfew?
To help answer that question, imagine yourself in this situation: It’s 30 minutes past your son’s curfew, and you hear
the front door slowly creak open. ‘He hopes that I’ve gone to
bed,’ you think to yourself. You haven’t, of course. In fact,
you’ve been sitting near the door since the
time your son was supposed to come home.
SEE VOLUME 1,
CHAPTER 3,
The door is now fully open, and your son’s
AND VOLUME 2,

CHAPTER 22
you do?
You have options. You could make light of the matter.
‘Boys will be boys,’ you might tell yourself. Or you could swing
to the other extreme and say, “You’re grounded for life!” Rather than act impulsively, listen ?rst, in case there is a valid reason for his being late. Then you can turn a broken curfew into
a powerful teaching tool. How?
Suggestion: Tell your child that you will discuss the matter with him or her tomorrow. Then, at an appropriate time,
sit down and talk about how you will handle the matter.
Some parents have tried the following: If their son or daughter comes home after the time agreed on, then for the next
outing, the curfew will be moved 30 minutes earlier. On the
other hand, if the boy or girl regularly comes home on time
and builds up a record of reliable behavior, you might consider granting reasonable freedoms—on occasion, perhaps even

RULES

extending the curfew to a later time. It is important that your
child clearly knows what time he or she is expected to be
home and what consequences will be meted out for failure to
abide by the curfew you have set. You then need to enforce
those consequences.
Note, however, that the Bible says: “Let your reasonableness become known.” (Philippians 4:5) So, before imposing a
curfew, you might want to discuss the matter with your child,
allowing him or her to suggest a time and o?er reasons for
that preference. Take this request into consideration. If your
child has demonstrated himself or herself to be responsible,
you might be able to accommodate his or her wishes if they
are reasonable.
Punctuality is a part of life. Setting up a curfew, then, isn’t
just about getting your child o? the streets. It’s about teaching
a skill that will bene?t your child long after leaving home.

they do to you. Deep down, your adolescent does not want
to look foolish or invite unwanted attention. Patiently point

out that immodest styles are really not ?attering, and explain why.1 Recommend alternatives.
? Second, be reasonable. Ask yourself, ‘Does the garment violate a Bible principle, or is this just a matter of personal taste?’ (2 Corinthians 1:24; 1 Timothy 2:9, 10) If it is
a matter of taste, can you make a concession?
? Third, don’t just tell your adolescent what styles are
not acceptable. Help him or her to ?nd clothes that are appropriate. Why not use the worksheets on pages 82 and 83

Should I allow my child
to play electronic games?
Electronic games have come a long way since you were
a teen. As a parent, how can you help your child identify the
potential dangers and avoid them?
Little good will be accomplished by conSEE VOLUME 2,
demning the entire industry or by dogmatiCHAPTER 30
cally asserting that electronic games are a
complete waste of time. Remember, not all
games are bad. However, they can be addictive. So analyze
the amount of time your child spends playing these games.
Also, consider the type of games to which your child seems
attracted. You could even ask your child such questions as
these:
? Which game is the most popular among your classmates?
? What happens in the game?
? Why do you think the game is so popular?

RULES

You might ?nd that your child knows more about electronic games than you thought! Perhaps he or she has
even played games that you feel are objectionable. If that
is the case, don’t overreact. This is an opportunity for you
to help your child develop perceptive powers.—Hebrews
5:14.
Ask questions that will help your child determine why
the attraction to objectionable games exists. For example,
you could ask a question like this:
? Do you feel left out because you aren’t allowed to play
that particular game?
Some youths may play a certain game so that they will
have something to talk about with their peers. If this is so
in your child’s case, you will likely not address the situation
the way you would if you found that your child was attracted to games containing gory violence or sexual overtones.
—Colossians 4:6.
But what if your child is attracted to the negative elements of a game? Some youths may quickly insist that they
aren’t a?ected by computer-generated gore. ‘Just because
I do it on screen doesn’t mean I’ll do it in real life,’ they reason. If that’s how your child feels, draw his or her attention
to Psalm 11:5. As the wording of the scripture makes clear,
it is not just being violent that merits God’s disapproval
but loving violence does too. The same principle applies to
sexual immorality or any other vice that God’s Word condemns.—Psalm 97:10.
If electronic games pose a problem for your child, try
the following:
? Do not allow electronic games to be played in a secluded area, such as the bedroom.
? Set ground rules—for example, no games before ?nishing homework or dinner or some other essential activity.
300 young people ask

? Emphasize the value of activities that require physical
exertion.
? Watch your children play their electronic games—or,
better yet, play with them at times.
Of course, to guide your children in the matter of content, you need to have freeness of speech. So ask yourself,

What if my child is addicted to the cell phone,
the computer, or other electronic media?
Does your adolescent spend too much time online,
send and receive too many text messages, or have a better
relationship with his MP3 player than he has with you? If
so, what can you do?
You could just take the device away from your child.
But do not write o? all electronic media as evil. After all,
likely you use some form of electronic media that was not
available to your parents. So instead of simSEE VOLUME 1,
ply con?scating your adolescent’s device—unCHAPTER 36
less there is compelling reason to do so—why
not use this as an opportunity to train your son or daughter
to use electronic media wisely and with moderation? How
can you do that?
Sit down and discuss the matter with your adolescent.
First, state your concerns. Second, listen to what he or she
has to say. (Proverbs 18:13) Third, work out practical solutions. Don’t be afraid to set ?rm limits, but be reasonable. “When I had a problem with texting,” says a teenager
named Ellen, “my parents didn’t take away my phone; they
set guidelines. The way they handled it has helped me to

be balanced in my use of texting, even when my parents
aren’t there to monitor me.”
What if your son or daughter reacts defensively? Do not
conclude that your counsel has fallen on deaf ears. Instead, be patient and give your adolescent some time to
think about the matter. Chances are, he or she already
agrees with you and will make needed adjustments. Many
youths are similar to a teen named Hailey, who says: “At
?rst I was o?ended when my parents told me I was addicted to my computer. But later, the more I thought about it,
the more I realized that they were right.”

INDEPENDENCE
How much independence should I allow my child?
This question may seem to get complex when you consider privacy issues. For instance, what if your son is in his
bedroom with the door closed? Should you barge in without

knocking? Or what if your daughter left her cell phone behind as she rushed o? to school? Should you peek at her
stored text messages?
SEE VOLUME 1,
These are not easy questions to anCHAPTERS 3 AND 15
swer. As a parent, you have a right to
know what is going on in your adolescent’s life and an obligation to keep him or her safe. But you cannot forever be
a ‘helicopter parent,’ suspiciously hovering over your child
and monitoring his or her every move. How can you strike a
balance?
First, recognize that an adolescent’s desire for privacy
does not always spell trouble. Often, it is a normal part of
growth. Privacy helps adolescents ‘test their wings’ as they
forge their own friendships and think through their problems using their “power of reason.” (Romans 12:1, 2) Privacy helps adolescents develop thinking ability—a vital quality if they are to function as responsible adults. It also gives
them opportunity to meditate before making decisions or
answering di?cult questions.—Proverbs 15:28.
Second, realize that attempts to micromanage your adolescent’s life may breed resentment and rebellion. (Ephesians 6:4; Colossians 3:21) Does this mean that you should
back o?? No, for you are still the parent. However, the goal
is for your child to acquire a trained conscience. (Deuteronomy 6:6, 7; Proverbs 22:6) In the end, guidance is more effective than surveillance.
Third, discuss the matter with your adolescent. Listen to
his or her concerns. Might there be times when you could
be yielding? Let your adolescent know that you will allow
him or her a measure of privacy as long as your trust is not
betrayed. Outline the consequences of disobedience, and
follow through if it becomes necessary. Be assured that
you can give your adolescent some privacy without relinquishing your role as a caring parent.

When should my child
leave school?
“My teachers are boring!” “I get too much homework!”
“I struggle just to get passing grades—why even try?” Because of such frustrations, some youths are
SEE VOLUME 1,
tempted to quit school before they have acCHAPTER 19
quired the skills they will need to make a living. If your son or daughter wants to quit school, what can
you do? Try the following:
? Examine your own attitude toward education. Did you
view school as a waste of time—a ‘prison sentence’ that
you had to endure until the day you could pursue more important goals? If so, your attitude toward learning may have
rubbed o? on your children. The fact is, a well-rounded
education will help them acquire “practical wisdom and
thinking ability”—qualities they need in order to reach their
goals.—Proverbs 3:21.
? Provide the tools. Some who could be getting better grades simply don’t know how to study—or they don’t
have the appropriate environment for it. A good study area
might include an uncluttered desk with su?cient light and
research tools. You can help your child to make advancement—whether secular or spiritual—by providing the right
setting for pondering over new thoughts and ideas.—Compare 1 Timothy 4:15.
? Get involved. View teachers and guidance counselors
as your allies, not your enemies. Meet them. Know their
names. Talk to them about your child’s goals and challenges. If your child is struggling with grades, try to determine the cause. For example, does your child feel that
excelling at school will make him or her a target of bullying? Is there a problem with a teacher? What about the
304 young people ask

courses? Your child should be challenged by the curriculum, not overwhelmed by it. Another possibility: Could there
be an underlying physical cause, such as poor eyesight, or
a learning disability?
The more involved you are in your child’s training, both
secular and spiritual, the better chance your child has of
success.—Psalm 127:4, 5.

How will I know when my child
is ready to leave home?
Serena, quoted in Chapter 7 of this volume, fears leaving
home. What is one reason? She says: “Even when I want to
buy something with my own money, Dad won’t
SEE VOLUME 1,
let me. He says that’s his job. So the idea of
CHAPTER 7
having to pay my own bills is scary.” Serena’s
father no doubt means well, but do you think that he is helping to prepare his daughter to manage her own household?
—Proverbs 31:10, 18, 27.
Are your children overprotected and thus underprepared
to face living on their own? How can you know? Consider the
following four skills, also mentioned in Chapter 7 under the
subheading “Am I Prepared?”—but now do so from a parent’s
perspective.
Money management. Do your older children know how to
?ll out a tax return or what they need to do to comply with local tax laws? (Romans 13:7) Do they know how to use credit
responsibly? (Proverbs 22:7) Can they budget their income
and then live within their means? (Luke 14:28-30) Have they
felt the pleasure that comes from acquiring an item that they
bought with money they earned? Have they experienced the
even greater pleasure that comes from giving of their time
and resources to help others?—Acts 20:35.

INDEPENDENCE

Domestic skills. Do your daughters and sons know how to
cook meals? Have you taught them how to wash and iron
clothes? If they drive a car, can your children safely carry out
simple maintenance, such as changing a fuse, the oil, or a ?at
tire?
Social skills. When your older children have disagreements, do you always act as the referee, imposing the ?nal solution to the problem? Or have you trained your children to negotiate a peaceful solution to the problem and then report
back to you?—Matthew 5:23-25.
Personal spiritual routine. Do you tell your children what
they should believe, or do you persuade them? (2 Timothy 3:
14, 15) Rather than always answering their religious and moral questions, are you teaching them to develop “thinking ability”? (Proverbs 1:4) Would you want them to follow your pattern of personal Bible study, or would you want them to do
something better?1
Without a doubt, training your children in the above
areas takes time and considerable e?ort. But the rewards
are well worth it when the bittersweet time comes for you
to hug them good-bye.

SEX AND DATING

Should I talk to my child
about sex?
The subject of sex is being introduced to children at a
remarkably young age. The Bible long ago foretold that “the
last days” would be marked by “critical times hard to deal
with,” in which people would be “without self-control” and
“lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.” (2 Timothy
3:1, 3, 4) The trend of having casual sex is one of many indications
SEE VOLUME 1,
CHAPTERS 23, 25, AND 32,
that this prophecy has proved true.
AND VOLUME 2,
CHAPTERS 4-6, 28, AND 29
The world today is vastly di?erent from the one in which you were
raised. In some ways, though, the issues are the same. So
do not feel overwhelmed or intimidated by the bad in?uences that surround your children. Instead, be determined
to help them to do as the apostle Paul urged Christians
some 2,000 years ago, saying: “Put on the complete suit of
armor from God that you may be able to stand ?rm against
the machinations of the Devil.” (Ephesians 6:11) The fact
is, many Christian youths are putting up a commendable
?ght to do what is right, despite the negative in?uences
that surround them. How can you help your children to do
the same?
One way is to open a discussion, using selected chapters in Section 4 of this book and Sections 1 and 7 of

Volume 2. The chapters contain thought-provoking scriptures. Some highlight the true-life examples of those who
either took a stand for what is right and reaped blessings
or ignored God’s laws and paid the consequences. Other scriptures contain principles that can help your children
recognize the great privilege that they—and you—have of living by God’s laws. Why not plan to review this material with
them soon?

Should I let my child
start dating?
The dating issue is certain to be thrust upon your children
sooner or later. “I don’t even have to do anything!” says Phillip. “Girls ask me out, and I stand there thinking, ‘Oh, what
am I going to do now?’ It’s hard to say no because some of
them are very beautiful!”
SEE VOLUME 2,
The best thing that you can do as parCHAPTERS 1-3
ents is talk to your teen about dating,
perhaps using Chapter 1 in Volume 2 as a basis for discussion. Find out how your son or daughter feels about the challenges he or she faces at school and even in the Christian
congregation. Sometimes such discussions can take place
on informal occasions, such as “when you sit in your house
and when you walk on the road.” (Deuteronomy 6:6, 7) Whatever the setting, remember to be “swift about hearing, slow
about speaking.”—James 1:19.
If your son or daughter expresses interest in someone of
the opposite sex, don’t panic. “When my dad found out that I
had a boyfriend, he was so upset!” says one teenage girl. “He
tried to scare me by asking me all these questions about
whether I was ready for marriage—which, when you’re young,
can make you feel like you want to prolong the relationship
and prove your parents wrong!”

SEX AND DATING

If your teen knows that dating isn’t even up for discussion,
something tragic may happen—he or she may drive the relationship underground and date secretly. “When parents overreact,” says one girl, “it only makes kids want to hide the relationship more. They don’t stop. They just get sneakier.”
You will get far better results by having frank discussions.
Brittany, 20, says: “My parents have always been very open
with me about dating. It’s important for them to know whom
I’m interested in, and I think that’s nice! My dad will talk to the
person. If there are any concerns, my parents tell me. Usually I decide I’m not interested before it even reaches the dating
level.”
After reading Chapter 2 in Volume 2, though, you might
wonder, ‘Would my son or daughter date behind my back?’
Note what a number of youths say about why some are tempted to date secretly, and then think about the accompanying
questions.
“Some kids aren’t ?nding comfort at home, so they
decide to lean on a boyfriend or girlfriend.”—Wendy.
As a parent, how can you make sure that the emotional
needs of your children are adequately cared for? Are there
improvements you can make in this regard? If so, what are
they?
“When I was 14, an exchange student asked me to
be his girlfriend. I agreed. I thought it would be nice
to have a guy put his arms around me.”—Diane.
If Diane were your daughter, how would you address
this issue?
“Mobile phones make secret dating easy. Parents
have no idea what is going on!”—Annette.
What precautions can you take when it comes to your
children’s use of cell phones?

SEX AND DATING

“Secret dating is much easier when parents don’t
keep a close enough eye on what their children are
doing and with whom.”—Thomas.
Are there ways you can be more a part of your teenager’s life and still allow him or her appropriate freedoms?
“Often parents aren’t home when their children are.
Or they are too trusting about letting their children go
places with other people.”—Nicholas.
Think of your child’s closest associate. Do you really
know what they do when they are together?
“Secret dating can happen when parents are overly
strict.”—Paul.
Without compromising Bible laws and principles, how
can you “let your reasonableness become known”?—Philippians 4:5.
“In my early teens, I had low self-esteem and I craved
attention. I began e-mailing a boy in a neighboring
congregation and fell in love. He made me feel special.”—Linda.
Can you think of some healthier ways that Linda’s
needs could have been ful?lled at home?
Why not use Chapter 2 in Volume 2 as well as this section of the Appendix as a basis for discussion with your son
or daughter? The best countermeasure to secrecy is heartfelt and forthright communication.—Proverbs 20:5.

EMOTIONAL ISSUES

How should I respond if
my child talks about suicide?
In some parts of the world, suicide among the young
is disturbingly common. For example, in the United States,
suicide is the third leading cause of
SEE VOLUME 1,
death among young people between
CHAPTERS 13 AND 14,
the ages of 15 and 25, and during
AND VOLUME 2,
the past two decades, the suicide rate
CHAPTER 26
among those between the ages of 10
and 14 has doubled. Those most at risk include youths
who su?er from a mental-health disorder, those who have
a family history of suicide, and those who have attempted suicide in the past. Warning signs that a youth may be
thinking of taking his or her life include the following:
? Withdrawal from family and friends
? A change in eating and sleeping patterns
? A loss of interest in activities that were once
pleasurable
? A marked change in personality
? Drug or alcohol abuse
? Giving away prized possessions
? Talking about death or being preoccupied with
subjects related to it

EMOTIONAL ISSUES

One of the greatest mistakes a parent can make is to
ignore such warning signs. Take all threats seriously. Do
not hastily conclude that your child is simply going through
a phase.
Also, don’t be ashamed to get help for your son or
daughter if he or she su?ers from severe depression or another mental disorder. And if you suspect that your teen is
thinking about ending it all, ask him or her about it. The notion that a teen will be encouraged to commit suicide simply by talking about it is false. Many youths are relieved
when parents bring up the subject. So if your teen admits
to having thoughts of suicide, ?nd out if a plan has been
devised, and if so, how detailed it is. The more detailed the
plan, the more urgently you need to intervene.
Don’t assume that the depression will lift on its own.
And if it does seem to lift, don’t think that the problem is
solved. On the contrary, this could be the most dangerous
point. Why? Because while in the throes of deep depression, an adolescent may be too immobilized to act on his or
her suicidal feelings. However, when the dark feelings lift
and energy returns, the youth may have the stamina to carry out the act.
It is indeed tragic that as a result of their despair, some
youths consider ending it all. By being attentive to the signs
and responding to them, parents and other caring adults
may “speak consolingly to the depressed souls” and prove
to be like a place of refuge for young ones.—1 Thessalonians 5:14.

help. How can you help him to cope with his grief, while not ignoring your own?1 Try the following:
? Resist the urge to hide your feelings. Your child has
learned many of his most valuable lessons in life by watching
you. Learning how to cope with grief will be no exception.
Thus, do not feel that you must be strong for the child by hiding all your grief from him. This may only teach your son to do
the same. In contrast, when you express your emotional pain,
he learns that feelings are often better expressed than suppressed and that it is normal for him to feel saddened, frustrated, or even angry.
? Encourage your adolescent to talk. Without making him
feel pressured, encourage your adolescent child to discuss
what is in his heart. If he seems reluctant, why not discuss
Chapter 16 of this volume? Also, talk about the many fond
memories you have of your deceased mate. Acknowledge
how di?cult it will be for you to carry on. Hearing you express
your feelings will help your adolescent learn how to do the
same.
? Recognize your limitations. Understandably, you want
to be an unfailing support for your adolescent child during
this di?cult time. But remember, you have been severely affected by the loss of your beloved mate. So your emotional,
mental, and physical stamina may be somewhat diminished
for a time. (Proverbs 24:10) Hence, you may need to call on
the assistance of other adult family members and mature
friends for support. Asking for help is a sign of maturity. Proverbs 11:2 says: “Wisdom is with the modest ones.”
The best support you can have comes from Jehovah God
himself, who promises his worshippers: “I, Jehovah your God,
am grasping your right hand, the One saying to you, ‘Do not be
afraid. I myself will help you.’ ”—Isaiah 41:13.

If your daughter has fallen victim to an eating disorder,
what can you do?1 First, try to understand why she has resorted to this behavior.
It has been noted that many with eating disorders have
a low self-image and are perfectionist in nature, setting unreasonably high expectations for themselves. Make sure

Also take a close look at your own attitude toward food and weight. Have you unwittingly overemphasized these matters, either by word or by example?
Remember, youths are extremely conscious of their appearance. Even teasing about “baby fat” or the normal growth
spurt of adolescence can sow seeds of trouble in the mind
of an impressionable youth.
Once you have prayerfully thought the matter through,
have a heartfelt talk with your daughter. To do so, try the
following:
? Plan carefully what to say and when to say it.
? Express clearly your concern and your desire to help.
? Do not be surprised if the ?rst response is defensive.
? Be a patient listener.

SPIRITUALITY

How can I continue to teach my children spiritual
values as they enter adolescence?
The Bible says that Timothy was given spiritual training
“from infancy,” and as a parent, you have likely provided the
same for your children. (2 Timothy 3:15) When your children
become adolescents, however, your trainSEE VOLUME 1,
ing methods may need to adapt to new cirCHAPTER 38,
cumstances. Your growing children are beAND VOLUME 2,
ginning to grasp complex, abstract issues
CHAPTERS 34-36
that they could not fully comprehend when
they were younger. Now more than ever, you’ll need to appeal
to their “power of reason.”—Romans 12:1.
When writing to Timothy, Paul mentioned the things that
Timothy had ‘learned and was persuaded to believe.’ (2 Timothy 3:14) Your adolescents may now need to be “persuaded
to believe” the Bible truths that they have known since infancy. To reach their hearts, you need to do more than just tell
them what to do or to believe. They need to learn for themselves. How can you help? Start by giving them plenty of opportunity to reason on and talk about such questions as the
following:
? What convinces me that God exists?—Romans 1:20.
? How do I know that what I am being taught by my parents from the Bible is the truth?—Acts 17:11.

SPIRITUALITY

? What convinces me that Bible standards are for my
own good?—Isaiah 48:17, 18.
? How do I know that Bible prophecies will be ful?lled?
—Joshua 23:14.
? What convinces me that nothing in this world compares to “the excelling value of the knowledge of
Christ Jesus”?—Philippians 3:8.
? What does Christ’s ransom sacri?ce mean to me?
—2 Corinthians 5:14, 15; Galatians 2:20.
You might hesitate to have your adolescents ponder
such questions, fearing that they won’t be able to answer
them. But that’s like hesitating to look at the fuel gauge on
your car’s dashboard, fearing that it might be pointing to
empty. If it is, it’s best that you ?nd out while you can do
something about it! In the same way, now—while your adolescents are still at home—is the time to help them explore questions of faith and to become “persuaded to believe.”1
Remember, there’s nothing wrong with having your son
or daughter ask, “Why do I believe?” Diane, 22, re?ects
on doing so as a teenager. “I didn’t want to be insecure
about my beliefs,” she says. “Developing clear, ?rm answers made me realize that I liked being one of Jehovah’s
Witnesses! Whenever I was questioned about something
that I wouldn’t do, rather than replying, ‘It’s against my religion,’ I would say, ‘I don’t think it’s right.’ In other words, I
made the Bible’s view my view.”
Suggestion: To tap into your adolescent’s power of reason with regard to Bible standards, have him or her assume the role of the parent when a problem arises. For
example, suppose your daughter has asked permission to

SPIRITUALITY

Our teenager has lost interest in spiritual things.
What can we do?
First, don’t hastily conclude that your teen has rejected
your faith. In many cases, there is an underlying issue. For example, perhaps your teen
? Is facing pressure from peers and is timid about
standing out as di?erent for adhering to Bible principles
? Sees other youths (even siblings) excelling at Christian living and feels that measuring up to them is
impossible
? Is starving for friends but feels lonely or out of place
among fellow believers
? Sees other “Christian” youths leading a double life
? Is striving to carve out a personal identity and as
a result feels compelled to question the values you
hold dear
? Sees classmates freely engaging in wrongdoing and
seemingly not su?ering any bad consequences
? Is trying to win the approval of a

CHAPTER 39,

SPIRITUALITY

Signi?cantly, issues such as these have little to do with
the tenets of your faith. They have more to do with circumstances that make practicing faith a challenge—at least for
now. So, what can you do to encourage your teen?
Make concessions—without compromising. Try to understand the cause of your adolescent’s discouragement,
and make adjustments so that your child will have a better
environment in which to thrive spiritually. (Proverbs 16:20)
For example, the “Peer-Pressure Planner” on pages 132
and 133 of Volume 2 can instill con?dence in your child so
that he or she is less timid about facing up to schoolmates.
Or if your adolescent is lonely, you might need to take an
active role in helping him or her ?nd good associates.
Provide a mentor. Sometimes youths are helped when
an adult outside the family provides encouragement. Do
you know someone whose spiritual outlook could be an inspiration to your adolescent? Why not arrange for him or
her to spend time with your son or daughter? Your purpose
is not to abdicate your responsibility. But think of Timothy.
He bene?ted greatly from the apostle Paul’s example, and
Paul bene?ted greatly by having Timothy as a companion.
—Philippians 2:20, 22.
As long as your adolescent lives under your roof, you
have the right to require compliance with a spiritual routine.
In the end, however, your goal is to instill love for God in
your teen’s heart—not simply to elicit some mechanical action. To help your teen embrace true religion, set an example worthy of imitation. Be reasonable in what you expect.
Provide a mentor and upbuilding associates. Perhaps one
day your adolescent will be able to say, as did the psalmist,
“Jehovah is my crag and my stronghold and the Provider of
escape for me.”—Psalm 18:2.
