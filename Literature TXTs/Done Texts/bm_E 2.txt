Section Section
BEFORE you pick up a Bible and start reading, it is
helpful to know a few things about how this book
is arranged. Also known as the Holy Scriptures, the Bible
is actually a collection of 66 books, or sections, beginning
with Genesis and ending with Revelation, or
Apocalypse.
Who is the Bible’s author? That is an intriguing
question. The fact is, the Scriptures were penned by
some 40 men over a span of about 1,600 years. Remarkably,
those men did not claim to be the authors of the
Bible. One of the penmen wrote: “All Scripture is inspired
of God.” (2 Timothy 3:16) Another of the writers
said: “The spirit of Jehovah it was that spoke by me,
and his word was upon my tongue.” (2 Samuel 23:2)
The writers thus claimed that Jehovah God, the Supreme
Ruler of the universe, is the Bible’s Author. God,
the writers reveal, wants to be close to humans.
There is something else that is essential to understanding
the Bible. The Scriptures have one overall
theme: the vindication of God’s right to rule humankind
by means of his heavenly Kingdom. On the pages
that follow, you will see how this theme is a common
thread running from Genesis to Revelation.
With the foregoing in mind, consider now the message
found in theworld’s most popular book, the Bible.
Why Examine the Bible?
Are you familiar with the Bible? This unique work is by
far the most widely distributed book in history. People of
all cultures have found its message to be a source of
comfort and hope and its advice to be practical for daily
living. Yet, many today know little about the Bible.
Whether you are religious or not, perhaps you are curious
about it. This brochure is designed to give you an
overview of the Bible.
? It was written over a period of 1,610
years, from 1513 B.C.E. to 98 C.E.
? The first 39 books—written mostly
in Hebrew, with some parts in
Aramaic—are known as the Hebrew
Scriptures, or “Old Testament.”
? The last 27 books—written in
Greek—are known as the Christian
Greek Scriptures, or “New Testament.”
? The Bible is divided into chapters
and verses. For example, Matthew 6:
9, 10 refers to the 6th chapter of the
book of Matthew, verses 9 and 10.
 There are various ways of expressing dates.
In this brochure, C.E. denotes “Common Era”
and B.C.E. means “Before the Common Era.”
You will see this illustrated in the time line that
runs along the bottom of the pages.
HELPFUL FACTS ABOUT THE BIBLE

THEY have been called the most famous
opening words ever written.
“In the beginning God created the heavens
and the earth.” (Genesis 1:1) With
that simple, majestic sentence, the Bible
introduces us to the Person who is the
central figure throughout the Holy Scriptures—
the almighty God, Jehovah. The
Bible’s first verse reveals that God is the
Creator of the vast physical universe,
including the planet we live on. The
verses that follow explain that in a series
of long periods, figuratively called
days, God went on to prepare our earthly
home, bringing into existence all the
wonders of our natural world.
The greatest of God’s earthly creations
was man. Here was a creature made in
the image of God—able to reflect Jehovah’s
own personal qualities, such as his
love and wisdom. God made man out of
the dust of the earth. God named him
Adam, then placed him in a paradise
—the garden of Eden. God himself planted
that garden, filling it with beautiful,
fruitful trees.
God saw the need for man to have a
mate. Using one of Adam’s ribs, God
made a woman and brought her to the
man as his wife, later named Eve. Elated,
Adam burst into poetry, saying: “This is
at last bone of my bones and flesh of my
flesh.” God explained: “That is why a
man will leave his father and his mother
and he must stick to his wife and they
must become one flesh.”—Genesis 2:22-
24; 3:20.
God gave Adam and Eve two commands.
First, he directed them to cultivate
and care for their earthly home and
eventually fill it with their offspring. Second,
he told them not to eat the fruit of
just one tree in all that vast garden, “the
tree of the knowledge of good and bad.”
(Genesis 2:17) If they disobeyed, they
would die. With those commands, God
gave the man and the woman a way to
show that they accepted him as their
Ruler. Their obedience would also show
their love and gratitude. They had every
reason to accept his kindly rule. There
was no flaw in those perfect humans.
The Bible tells us: “God saw everything
he had made and, look! it was very
good.”—Genesis 1:31.
—Based on Genesis chapters 1 and 2.

The Holy Scriptures refer to God
by various titles, such as Creator and
Almighty God. Some titles stress God’s
attributes, such as his holiness, his
power, his justice, his wisdom, and his
love. However, God also gave himself a
unique personal name—Jehovah. In the
Bible as written in its original languages,
this divine name appeared about 7,000
times, first at Genesis 2:4. The name
Jehovah means “He Causes to Become.”
That is comforting to know, for it means
that God can carry out any purpose that
he has in mind and can fulfill any
promise that he makes.

LONG before creating humans, God
created many invisible spirit creatures—
angels. In Eden, a rebellious angel,
who came to be known as Satan the Devil,
slyly endeavored to tempt Eve into eating
the fruit of the one tree that God had
ruled out.
Using a serpent, or snake, as a mouthpiece,
Satan implied that God was withholding
something desirable from the
woman and her husband. The angel told
Eve that she and her husband would not
die if they ate the forbidden fruit. Satan
thus accused God of lying to His human
children. The Deceiver presented disobedience
to God as an appealing course
that would lead to enlightenment and
freedom. But this was all a lie—in fact,
the first lie ever spoken on earth. The real
point at issue involved God’s sovereignty,
or supreme rulership—whether God
has the right to rule and whether he exercises
it in a righteous way and in the
best interests of his subjects.
Eve believed Satan’s lie. She began to
desire the fruit, and then she actually ate
some of it. Later she gave some to her
husband, and he also ate it. Thus they
became sinners. That seemingly simple
act was actually an expression of rebellion.
By deliberately choosing to disobey
God’s command, Adam and Eve rejected
the rule of the Creator who had given
them everything, including perfect
life.
God called the rebels to account for
their actions. He foretold the coming of
the promised Seed, or Deliverer, who
would destroy Satan, the one represented
by the serpent. God deferred the execution
of the death sentence
upon Adam and
Eve for a time, thereby
showing mercy to their
unborn offspring. Those
childrenwould have a basis
for hope because the
One whom God would send would undo
the tragic consequences set in motion by
the rebellion in Eden. Just how God’s
purpose concerning this future Savior
would be fulfilled—and who the sentforth
One would be—was gradually revealed
as Bible writing progressed.
God drove Adam and Eve out of Paradise.
Sweat and toil would be required to
eke out a living from the soil outside the
garden of Eden. Eve then became pregnant
and gave birth to Cain, the first
child of Adam and Eve. The couple had
other sons and daughters, including Abel
and Seth, the forefather of Noah.
—Based on Genesis chapters 3 to 5; Revelation 12:9.

God created Adam and Eve perfect,
with the prospect of living forever in
Paradise. When they rebelled against
God, they sinned. Adam and Eve
thereby lost perfection and severed
their relationship with the Source of life,
Jehovah. From then on, they and all
their imperfect descendants could not
avoid sin and ultimately death.
—Romans 5:12.
IMPERFECTION AND DEATH
2500 B.C.E. Floodwaters fall 2370
AS MANKIND multiplied, sin and
wickedness spread rapidly in the
earth. A lone prophet named Enoch
warned that God would one day destroy
the ungodly. Still, evil prevailed
and even worsened. Some angels rebelled
against Jehovah by leaving their
assigned places in heaven, assuming human
form on earth, and greedily taking
women as wives. Those unnatural
unions produced hybrid offspring—giant
bullies called Nephilim who intensified
the world’s violence and bloodshed. God
was deeply hurt to see his earthly creation
being ruined.
After Enoch’s death, one man stood
out in that wicked world. His name was
Noah. He and his family tried to do what
was right in God’s eyes. When God decided
to destroy the wicked people of
that world, he wanted to protect Noah
and earth’s animal creation. So God told
him to build an ark—a huge rectangular
vessel. In it, Noah and his family would
be preserved alive, along with numerous
animal species, through a coming global
flood. Noah obeyed God. During the decades
that Noah spent building that ark,
he was also “a preacher of righteousness.”
(2 Peter 2:5) He warned people
about the coming Flood, but they ignored
him. The time came for Noah and
his family to enter the ark with the animals.
God shut the door of the ark behind
them. The rain fell.
The rain came down in torrents for 40
days and 40 nights until the whole earth
was submerged. The wicked were gone.
Months later, as the waters receded, the
ark came to rest on a mountain. By the
time the ark’s passengers could emerge
safely, they had spent a full year aboard.
In thanksgiving, Noah presented an offering
to Jehovah. God responded by
assuring Noah and his family that He
would never again bring a flood to wipe
out all life on the surface of the earth. Jehovah
provided the rainbow as a visible
guarantee, a reminder of this comforting
promise.
After the Flood, God also gave mankind
some new commands. He granted
them permission to eat the meat of animals.
However, he prohibited the eating
of blood. He also commanded Noah’s
descendants to spread abroad in the
earth, but some of them disobeyed. People
united under a leader named Nimrod
and began to build a great tower in the
city of Babel, later called Babylon. Their
aim was to defy God’s command about
spreading throughout the earth. But God
thwarted the rebels by confusing their
one language and causing them to speak
in various tongues. Unable to communicate,
they abandoned the project and
scattered.
—Based on Genesis chapters 6 to 11; Jude 14, 15.

Most of the offspring of Adam and Eve rejected
Jehovah’s rulership. However, there were exceptions,
starting with their faithful son Abel. Later, both Enoch
and Noah are said to have walked with God, meaning
that they followed a course pleasing to Jehovah.
(Genesis 5:22; 6:9) Much of the Bible record focuses on
men and women who likewise chose God as their Ruler.
WALKING WITH GOD
Abraham born 2018 1943 Abrahamic covenant 1800 B.C.E.
7
SOME 350 years had passed since the
Flood of Noah’s day. The patriarch
Abraham was living in the flourishing
city of Ur in what is today called Iraq.
Abrahamwas a man of outstanding faith.
But now his faith was put to the test.
Jehovah told Abraham to leave the
country of his birth and move to a
foreign land, which turned out to be
Canaan. Abraham obeyed without hesitation.
He took along his household, including
his wife, Sarah, and his nephew
Lot, and after the long trip became a tent
dweller in Canaan. In a covenant that He
made with Abraham, Jehovah promised
that He would make a great nation out of
him, that all the families of the earth
would be blessed by means of him, and
that his offspring would possess the land
of Canaan.
Abraham and Lot prospered, accumulating
huge flocks of sheep and herds of
cattle. Unselfishly, Abraham let Lot select
whatever territory he wished. Lot chose
the fertile district of the Jordan River
and settled near the city of Sodom. The
men of Sodom, however, were immoral
—gross sinners against Jehovah.
Jehovah God later reassured Abraham
that his offspring would become as numerous
as the stars of heaven. Abraham
put faith in that promise. Yet, Abraham’s
beloved wife, Sarah, remained childless.
Then, when Abraham was 99 years old
and Sarah was approaching 90, God told
Abraham that he and Sarah would have a
son. True to God’s word, Sarah gave birth
to Isaac. Abraham had other children,
but it would be through Isaac that the
Deliverer promised in Edenwould come.
Meanwhile, Lot and his family were
living in Sodom, but righteous Lot did
not become like the city’s immoral inhabitants.
When Jehovah determined to
execute judgment upon Sodom, he sent
angels ahead to warn Lot of the impending
destruction. The angels urged Lot
and his family to flee Sodom and not to
look back. God then made it rain fire and
sulfur on Sodom and the nearby wicked
city Gomorrah, destroying all their inhabitants.
Lot and his two daughters escaped.
But Lot’s wife looked back, perhaps
with longing for the things she had
left behind. For this disobedience, she
paid with her life.
—Based on Genesis 11:10–19:38.

In Bible times, a covenant was
a contract or formal agreement. By
means of a series of covenants, which
amounted to solemn promises,
Jehovah gradually revealed how his
purpose concerning the Deliverer
promised in Eden would be fulfilled.
The covenant made with Abraham
indicated that the promised One
would come through Abraham’s line
of descent. Later covenants would
shed more light on the identity of
that One.
A GOD OF COVENANTS
1800 B.C.E. Joseph sold as a slave 1750

JEHOVAH knew that the One dearest
to him would have to suffer and
die someday. The prophecy recorded at
Genesis 3:15 hinted at that truth. Could
God convey to mankind just how dearly
that death would cost him? The Bible
supplies a living illustration. God asked
Abraham to sacrifice his beloved son
Isaac.
Abraham had great faith. Remember,
God had promised him that the foretold
Deliverer, or Seed, would descend from
Isaac. Trusting that God would resurrect
Isaac if need be, Abraham was obediently
going to sacrifice his own son. But an
angel from God stopped Abraham just in
time. Praising Abraham for his willingness
to offer up what was most precious
to him, God repeated His promises to
the faithful patriarch.
Later, Isaac had two sons, Esau and
Jacob. Unlike Esau, Jacob appreciated
spiritual things and was rewarded. God
changed Jacob’s name to Israel, and Israel’s
12 sons became the heads of the
tribes of Israel. But how did that family
turn into a great nation?
A chain of events was set in motion
when most of those sons got jealous of
their younger brother Joseph. They sold
him as a slave, and he was taken off to
Egypt. But God blessed that faithful and
brave young man. Despite terrible hardships,
Joseph eventually was singled out
by Pharaoh, the Egyptian ruler, and given
great authority. That was timely, for a
famine caused Jacob to send some of his
sons to Egypt to buy foodstuffs—and Joseph,
it turned out, was in charge of all
the food! After a dramatic reunion with
his repentant brothers, Joseph forgave
them and arranged for the whole family
to move to Egypt. They were given
prime land, where they could continue
to grow and prosper. Joseph understood
that God had arranged matters in that
way in order to fulfill His promises.
Aged Jacob lived out his days in Egypt,
surrounded by his growing family. On
his deathbed, he foretold that the promised
Seed, or Deliverer, would be a powerful
Ruler who would be born in the
family line of his son Judah. Before his
own death years later, Joseph prophesied
that one day God would take Jacob’s
family out of Egypt.
—Based on Genesis chapters 20 to 50; Hebrews
11:17-22.

Job’s trial before 1613 1600 B.C.E.
9
WOULD any human remain faithful
to God if tested to the limit
and if obedience seemed to bring
no material benefits? That question
was raised—and answered—in connection
with a man named Job.
While the Israelites were still in Egypt,
Job, a relative of Abraham, was living in
what is now Arabia. Meanwhile, the angels
in heaven gathered before God, and
rebellious Satan was among them. Before
the heavenly assembly, Jehovah expressed
his confidence in his loyal servant
Job. In fact, Jehovah said that no
other human had integrity like that of
Job. But Satan asserted that Job served
God only because God had blessed and
protected him. Satan claimed that if Job
were stripped of everything he had, he
would curse God.
God permitted Satan to deprive Job
first of his wealth and children and
then of his health. Unaware of Satan’s
role in all of this, Job could not understand
why God allowed him to experience
these trials. Still, Job never turned
against God.
Three false friends came to Job. In a series
of speeches that fill many pages
of the book of Job, the men wrongly
tried to convince Job that God was punishing
him for hidden sins. They even
claimed that God neither finds pleasure
in his servants nor puts trust in them.
Job rejected their faulty reasoning.With
confidence, Job declared that he would
maintain his integrity down to death!
But Job made the mistake of becoming
overly concerned with justifying
himself. A younger man named Elihu,
who had been listening to the entire debate,
spoke up. Elihu reproved Job for
failing to appreciate that the vindication
of Jehovah God’s sovereignty is far
more important than the vindication of
any human. Elihu also strongly rebuked
Job’s false friends.
Jehovah God then spoke to Job, correcting
his thinking. Pointing to many
marvels of creation, Jehovah gave Job a
lesson in man’s littleness compared to
God’s greatness. Job humbly accepted
the correction from God. Jehovah, being
“very tender in affection and merciful,”
restored Job’s health, gave him double
his previous wealth, and blessed him
with ten children. (James 5:11) By keeping
integrity to Jehovah while under severe
trial, Job successfully answered Satan’s
challenge that humans will not
remain faithful to God if put to the test.
—Based on the book of Job.

Revelation
By asserting that Job—the most
blameless and God-fearing man then
on earth—served Jehovah God for selfish
reasons only, Satan implied that the
same was true of all intelligent creatures.
Satan thus raised the question of man’s
integrity to Jehovah. This is part of the
overall issue that Satan raised in Eden,
namely, the rightfulness and
righteousness of Jehovah’s sovereignty.
The book of Job shows that God’s
creatures can contribute to the
vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty by
maintaining their integrity to Him.
THE VITAL ISSUES
1600 B.C.E. Exodus from Egypt 1513
FOR many years, the sons of Israel lived
in Egypt, prospering and multiplying.
However, a new Pharaoh rose up.
This ruler did not know Joseph. A vicious
tyrant who feared the Israelites’
growing numbers, he turned them into
slaves and ordered that all their newborn
males be drowned in the Nile River. But
one brave mother protected her infant
son, hiding him in a basket among the
reeds. Pharaoh’s daughter discovered the
baby, named him Moses, and raised him
among Egyptian royalty.
When Moses was 40 years old, he got
into trouble defending an Israelite slave
from an Egyptian taskmaster. Moses fled
to a faraway land, where he lived in exile.
When Moses was 80, Jehovah sent him
back to Egypt to appear before Pharaoh
and demand the release of God’s people.
Pharaoh flatly refused. So God struck
Egypt with ten plagues. Each time that
Moses appeared before Pharaoh to offer
him an opportunity to avert the next
plague, Pharaoh proved defiant, holding
Moses and his God, Jehovah, in contempt.
Finally, the tenth plague brought
death to all the firstborn in the land—except
in families who obeyed Jehovah by
marking their doorposts with the blood
of a sacrificed lamb. God’s angel of destruction
passed over those households.
The Israelites thereafter commemorated
this marvelous rescue by means of an annual
celebration called the Passover.
Having lost his own firstborn son, Pharaoh
ordered Moses and all the Israelites
to leave Egypt. They immediately organized
the Exodus. But Pharaoh changed
his mind. He chased after them with
many warriors and chariots. The Israelites
appeared to be trapped at the shore of the
Red Sea. Jehovah parted the Red Sea, allowing
the Israelites to pass through on
a dry seabed, between walls of water!
When the Egyptians rushed in behind
them, God let the waters come crashing
down, drowning Pharaoh and his army.
Later, as the Israelites camped by
Mount Sinai, Jehovah made a covenant
with them. Using Moses as mediator,
God gave Israel laws to provide guidance
and protection in virtually every aspect of
life. As long as Israel faithfully accepted
God’s rule, Jehovah would be with them
and would make that nation a blessing to
others.
However, most of the Israelites showed
a disappointing lack of faith in God. Jehovah
therefore made that generation
wander in the wilderness for 40 years.
Then, Moses commissioned the upright
man Joshua to succeed him. Finally, Israel
was poised to enter the land that God
had promised to Abraham.

Psalm 136:10-15; Acts 7:17-36.

God with your whole heart and with your whole soul
and with your whole mind and with your whole

THE GREATEST LAW
1473 Israel enters Canaan under Joshua
1467 Major conquest of Canaan completed 1200 B.C.E.
11
CENTURIES before Israel entered Canaan,
Jehovah promised that land
to Abraham’s descendants. Now under
Joshua’s leadership, the Israelites were
about to take possession of the Promised
Land.
God had judged the Canaanites worthy
of destruction. They had saturated
the land with extremely degrading
sexual practices as well as with wanton
bloodshed. Therefore, the Canaanite cities
conquered by the Israelites were to be
completely destroyed.
Before entering the land, however,
Joshua sent out two spies, who stayed in
the city of Jericho with a woman named
Rahab. She received the spies into her
home and protected them even though
she knew that they were Israelites. Rahab
had faith in the God of the Israelites,
having heard about Jehovah’s saving
acts in behalf of his people. She made
the spies swear to her that she and her
household would be spared.
Later, when the Israelites entered Canaan
and came against Jericho, Jehovah
miraculously caused the collapse of Jericho’s
walls. Joshua’s troops dashed in
and destroyed the city, but they spared
Rahab and her family. Then, in a swift
six-year campaign, Joshua conquered
large sections of the Promised Land. Afterward,
the land was distributed to the
tribes of Israel.
Near the end of his long career, Joshua
called the people together. He reviewed
with them Jehovah’s dealings
with their forefathers and appealed to
them to serve Jehovah. After Joshua and
his close associates died, however, the Israelites
left Jehovah to serve false gods.
For some 300 years, the nation did not
consistently obey Jehovah’s laws. During
that time, Jehovah allowed Israel’s enemies,
such as the Philistines, to oppress
them. But when the Israelites called to
Jehovah for aid, he raised up judges—12
in all—to save them.
The period of the Judges recounted in
the book of Judges began with Othniel
and ended with Samson, physically the
strongest man who ever lived. The basic
truth demonstrated over and over
again in the thrilling account recorded
in the Bible book of Judges
is this: Obedience to Jehovah
leads to blessings, disobedience
to calamity.
—Based on Joshua; Judges; Leviticus
18:24, 25.

AFTER the days of Samson, Samuel
served as prophet and judge in Israel.
The Israelites kept telling him that
they wanted to be like other nations
and have a human king over them. Although
this request was an affront to Jehovah,
he directed Samuel to comply.
God selected a humble man named Saul
to be king. In time, though, King Saul
turned haughty and disobedient. Jehovah
rejected himas king
and told Samuel to appoint
another—a young
man named David. It
would be years, though,
before David would become
king.
Likely when still in
his teens, David visited his brothers
who were serving in Saul’s army. The
whole army was terrified of one enemy
warrior, a giant named Goliath,
who kept taunting them and their God.
Indignant, David accepted the giant’s
challenge to meet in combat. Armed
with only a sling and a few stones, the
young man went out to meet his opponent,
who was over nine feet tall.
When Goliath mocked him, David replied
that he was better armed than the
giant, for David fought in the name of
Jehovah God! David felled Goliath with
a single stone and then beheaded him
with the giant’s own sword. The Philistine
army fled in terror.
At first, Saul was impressed with David’s
courage and placed the young
man over his army. But David’s successes
made Saul bitterly jealous. David had
to flee for his life and live as a fugitive
for years. Still, David remained
loyal to the king who was trying to
kill him, reasoning that King Saul had
been appointed by Jehovah God. Finally,
Saul died in battle. Before long, David
became king, as Jehovah had promised.
As king, David dearly wished to build
a temple to Jehovah. However, Jehovah
told David that one of his descendants
would do so. That turned out to
be David’s son Solomon. God rewarded
David, though, by making a thrilling
covenant with him: His family line
would produce a kingly dynasty unlike
any other. Ultimately, it would produce
the Deliverer, or Seed, promised in
Eden. That one would be the Messiah,
meaning “Anointed One,” appointed
by God. Jehovah promised that the
Messiah would be the Ruler of a government,
or Kingdom, that would last forever.
Deeply grateful, David gathered vast
quantities of building materials and
precious metals for the temple project.
He also composed many inspired
psalms. Near the end of his life, David
acknowledged: “The spirit of Jehovah it
was that spoke by me, and his word was
upon my tongue.”—2 Samuel 23:2.

WHATwould life be like if an entire
nation and its ruler followed Jehovah
as their Sovereign and obeyed
His laws? The answer was demonstrated
during the 40-year-reign of King Solomon.
Before David died, he appointed his
son Solomon as his successor. In a
dream, God invited Solomon to make a
request. Solomon asked for wisdom and
knowledge to judge the people fairly
and wisely. Jehovah was pleased and
gave Solomon a wise and understanding
heart. Jehovah also promised him riches,
glory, and long life if he remained
obedient.
Solomon became famous for his wise
judgments. In one case, two women argued
over a baby boy, each claiming to
be the mother. Solomon ordered that
the baby be cut in two and that half be
given to each woman. The first woman
agreed, but the real mother at once
pleaded that the child be given to the
other woman. Solomon now saw clearly
that the compassionate woman was the
mother and gave the boy to her. Soon all
Israel heard about this judicial decision,
and the people recognized that the wisdom
of God was within Solomon.
One of Solomon’s grandest achievements
was the construction of Jehovah’s
temple—a magnificent structure in Jerusalem
that would serve as a center of
worship in Israel. At the temple’s inauguration,
Solomon prayed: “Look! The
heavens, yes, the heaven of the heavens,
themselves cannot contain you; how
much less, then, this house that I have
built!”—1 Kings 8:27.
Solomon’s reputation spread to other
lands, even as far as Sheba, in Arabia.
The queen of Sheba traveled to see Solomon’s
glory and riches and to test the
depth of his wisdom. The queen was so
impressed with Solomon’s wisdom and
the prosperity of Israel that she praised
Jehovah for putting such a wise king
on the throne. Indeed, with Jehovah’s
blessing, Solomon’s rule was the most
prosperous and peaceful in the history
of ancient Israel.
Sadly, Solomon failed to continue acting
in harmony with Jehovah’s wisdom.
Ignoring God’s command, he
married hundreds of women, including
many whoworshipped foreign gods.
Gradually his wives inclined his heart
away from Jehovah to the worship of
idols. Jehovah told Solomon that part of
the kingdom would be
ripped away from him.
Only a portion would
remain with his family,
God said, for the sake
of Solomon’s father, David.
Despite Solomon’s
defection, Jehovah remained
loyal to his Kingdom
covenant with David.

11; 2 Chronicles chapters 1 to 9;
Deuteronomy 17:17.

THE largest book in the Bible is a compilation
of sacred songs. The entire
book was about 1,000 years in the making.
The book of Psalms contains some
of the most profound and moving expressions
of faith ever put in writing. A
wide array of human emotion is represented
here, from joy, praise, and thanksgiving
to grief, sorrow, and repentance. It
is clear that the psalmists had a trusting,
intimate relationship with God. Consider
some of the themes developed in
these lyrical works.
Jehovah is the rightful Sovereign,
worthy of worship and praise. “You,
whose name is Jehovah, you alone are
the Most High over all the earth,” we
read at Psalm 83:18. Several psalms
praise Jehovah for his works of creation,
such as the starry heavens, the wonders
of life on earth, and the marvels of the
human body. (Psalms 8, 19, 139, 148)
Others glorify Jehovah as the God who
acts to save and protect those loyal to
him. (Psalms 18, 97, 138) Still others exalt
him as the God of justice, who brings
relief to the oppressed and punishment
to the wicked.—Psalms 11, 68, 146.
Jehovah brings help and comfort to
those who love him. Perhaps the most
famous psalm is the 23rd, in which David
describes Jehovah as a loving Shepherd,
who guides, protects, and cares
for his sheep. Psalm 65:2 reminds God’s
worshippers that Jehovah is the “Hearer
of prayer.” Many who have fallen into serious
wrongdoing have found great comfort
in Psalms 39 and 51, where David
puts his repentance over grave errors into
heartfelt words and expresses his faith in
Jehovah’s forgiveness. Psalm 55:22 contains
an exhortation to trust in Jehovah
and to put all personal burdens on Him.
Jehovah will change the world
through the Kingdom of the Messiah.
A number of passages in the Psalms clearly
apply to the Messiah, the foretold
King. Psalm 2 prophesies that this Ruler
will destroy the wicked nations, who oppose
him. Psalm72 reveals that this King
will end hunger, injustice, and oppression.
According to Psalm 46:9, through
the Messiah’s Kingdom, God will end
warfare and even destroy all weapons of
war. In Psalm37, we read that the wicked
will be done away with, whereas righteous
people will live on earth forever,
enjoying global peace and harmony.

love. He chronicles his attempt to win
the heart of a beautiful young virgin
who was already in love with a
shepherd boy. This inspired song
shows that when people feel a strong
physical attraction, they need not act
in an undignified way. The young
couple display admirable self-control,
chasteness, and loyalty.
THE SONG OF SONGS
Compiling of Proverbs completed circa 717 700 B.C.E.
IS Jehovah a wise Ruler? One decisive
way to answer that question is to consider
the counsel he gives. Does it work?
Does applying it make life better and
more meaningful? Wise King Solomon
wrote hundreds of proverbs. These touch
on virtually every aspect of life. Consider
some examples.
Trusting in God. Trust is key to a
good relationship with Jehovah. Solomon
wrote: “Trust in Jehovah with all
your heart and do not lean upon your
own understanding. In all your ways take
notice of him, and he himself will make
your paths straight.” (Proverbs 3:5, 6)
Trusting in God by seeking his guidance
and obeying himbrings profound meaning
to life. Such a course enables a human
to make God’s heart rejoice and
gives Jehovah a reply to the issues raised
by His adversary, Satan.—Proverbs 27:11.
Dealing wisely with others. God’s
counsel for husbands, wives, and children
is more timely today than ever. “Rejoice
with the wife of your youth,” God
advises the husband, directing that he remain
faithful to his wife. (Proverbs 5:18-
20) Married women find in the book of
Proverbs a glowing description of a capable
wife who wins the admiration of her
husband and children. (Proverbs, chapter
31) And children find direction to
obey their parents. (Proverbs 6:20) This
book also shows that friendships are vital,
as isolation breeds selfishness. (Proverbs
18:1) Friends can influence us for
good or for bad, so we need to choose
themwisely.—Proverbs 13:20; 17:17.
Dealing wisely with oneself. The
book of Proverbs contains priceless
counsel on avoiding alcohol abuse, cultivating
healthful emotions and combating
destructive ones, and being an industrious
worker. (Proverbs 6:6; 14:30; 20:1)
It warns that trusting in human judgment
apart from the counsel of God
leads to disaster. (Proverbs 14:12) It urges
us to protect the inner self, the heart,
against corrupting influences, reminding
us that “out of [the heart] are the
sources of life.”—Proverbs 4:23.
Millions of people the world over have
found that living by such counsel makes
for a better life. As a result, they have ample
reason to accept Jehovah as their
Ruler.

Where can satisfaction and meaning in life be found?
Solomon was in a unique position to seek the answer.
With immense wealth, wisdom, and authority, he was
able to investigate whether these could bring him
genuine fulfillment. He pursued the pleasures of
material things, married many beautiful women, and
enjoyed the best in recreation. He undertook great
building projects. He explored the wisdom of learned
writings. What did he find? “Everything is vanity.”
However, he came to this profound realization: “The
conclusion of the matter, everything having been
heard, is: Fear the true God and keep his
commandments. For this is the whole obligation of
man.”—Ecclesiastes 12:8, 13.
ECCLESIASTES
700 B.C.E. Jerusalem destroyed; exile in Babylon begins 607
JUST as Jehovah had foretold, Israel was
divided after Solomon defected from
pure worship. His son and successor, Rehoboam,
was harsh. In response, ten of
Israel’s tribes revolted and formed the
northern kingdom of Israel. Two tribes
remained loyal to the king on David’s
throne in Jerusalem, forming the southern
kingdom of Judah.
Both kingdoms had a tumultuous history,
largely on account of faithless and
disobedient kings. Israel fared even worse
than Judah, for its kings promoted false
worship from the start. Despite the powerful
works of such prophets as Elijah
and Elisha—both of whom even resurrected
the dead—Israel kept reverting to a
wicked course. Finally, God allowed the
northern kingdom to be destroyed by Assyria.
Judah lasted a little more than a century
longer than Israel, but it too faced
divine punishment. Only a few Judean
kings responded to the warnings of
God’s prophets and tried to lead the nation
back to Jehovah. King Josiah, for example,
began to cleanse Judah of false
worship and restored Jehovah’s temple.
When an original copy of God’s Law given
through Moses was found, Josiah was
deeply moved and therefore intensified
his campaign of reform.
Sadly, though, Josiah’s successors did
not follow that king’s good example. Jehovah
thus allowed the nation of Babylon
to conquer Judah, destroying Jerusalem
and its temple. The survivors were
taken into exile in Babylon. God foretold
that the exile would last 70 years. Judah
lay desolate for all that time—until, as
promised, the nation was allowed to return
to its own soil.
However, no more kings in David’s
line would rule until the reign of the
promised Deliverer, the foretold Messiah.
Most of the kings who had sat on David’s
throne in Jerusalem proved that imperfect
humans are not qualified to rule.
Only the Messiah would be truly qualified.
Jehovah thus said to the last of
those Davidic kings: “Lift off the crown.
. . . It will certainly become no one’s until
he comes who has the legal right, and
I must give it to him.”—Ezekiel 21:26, 27.

36; Jeremiah 25:8-11.

During the time of the divided kingdom, God
assigned Jonah to go and preach a warning message to
the people in the violent, faraway city of Nineveh.
Instead, Jonah boarded a ship headed the other way.
That led to a miracle—God caused a huge fish to
swallow Jonah. Inside the fish, Jonah prayed to
Jehovah, who then caused the fish to vomit him out
onto dry land. Jonah then carried out his assignment.
After God taught Jonah that lesson in obedience,
a second problem surfaced: Jonah preached to the
Ninevites, but he was highly displeased when God
showed them mercy by compassionately holding back
punishment because they repented. Read this
fascinating book to see how God used a second miracle
to teach Jonah to be more compassionate.

DURING the period of the kings of
Israel and Judah, a special group
of men came to the fore—the prophets.
These were men of extraordinary
faith and courage who delivered God’s
pronouncements. Consider four important
themes developed by God’s prophets.
1. The destruction of Jerusalem.
Long in advance, God’s prophets—Isaiah
and Jeremiah in particular—began
warning that Jerusalem would be destroyed
and abandoned. In vivid terms,
they revealed why the city had incurred
God’s anger. Her claimto represent Jehovah
was belied by false religious practices,
corruption, and violence.—2 Kings
21:10-15; Isaiah 3:1-8, 16-26; Jeremiah
2:1–3:13.
2. The restoration of pure worship.
After 70 years in exile, God’s people
would be freed from Babylon. They
would return to their desolate homeland
and rebuild the temple of Jehovah in Jerusalem.
(Jeremiah 46:27; Amos 9:13-
15) About 200 years in advance, Isaiah
foretold the name of the conqueror—Cyrus—
who would defeat Babylon and allow
God’s people to restore pure worship.
Isaiah even detailed Cyrus’ unique
battle strategy.—Isaiah 44:24–45:3.
3. The Messiah’s arrival and his experiences.
The Messiah would be
born in the town of Bethlehem. (Micah
5:2) He would be humble, presenting
himself in Jerusalem, riding upon
an ass. (Zechariah 9:9) Though gentle
and kind, he would be unpopular, and
many would reject him. (Isaiah 42:1-3;
53:1, 3) He would experience a cruel
death. Would his life then be over for
all time? No, for his sacrifice was to
make possible the forgiveness of sins for
many. (Isaiah 53:4, 5, 9-12) Only his resurrection
could accomplish that.
4. The reign of the Messiah over
the earth. Imperfect humans are really
unable to govern themselves peacefully,
but the Messianic King would be called
Prince of Peace. (Isaiah 9:6, 7; Jeremiah
10:23) Under his rule, all humans would
be at peace with one another and even
with all the animal creation. (Isaiah 11:
3-7) Sicknesswould vanish. (Isaiah 33:24)
Even death would be swallowed up forever.
(Isaiah 25:8) During the Messiah’s
reign, people who had died would be resurrected
to life on earth.—Daniel 12:13.
—Based on the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah,
Daniel, Amos, Micah, and
Zechariah.

DANIEL, a youth of remarkable integrity,
was taken into exile in Babylon
before Jerusalem was destroyed. He
and some other Jews—exiles from the
vanquished kingdom of Judah—were
granted a measure of freedom by their
captors. During his long life in Babylon,
Daniel was greatly blessed by God, even
escaping death in a lions’ pit and receiving
visions that allowed him to peer far
into the future. Daniel’s most important
prophecies focused on the Messiah and
His rule.
Daniel learns when the Messiah
would arrive. Daniel was told when
God’s people could expect the arrival
of “Messiah the Leader”—69 weeks of
years after the command to restore and
rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. A normal
week consists of seven days; a week
of years consists of seven years. That
command was issued long after Daniel’s
time, that is, in 455 B.C.E. Starting then,
the 69 “weeks” ran for 483 years, ending
in the year 29 C.E. In the following part
of this publication, we will see what
happened in that year. Daniel also foresaw
that the Messiah would be “cut off,”
or executed, for the atonement of sin.
—Daniel 9:24-26.
The Messiah would become King in
heaven. In a rare vision of heaven itself,
Daniel saw the Messiah, referred to as
“someone like a son of man,” approach
the throne of Jehovah himself. Jehovah
conferred upon him “rulership and
dignity and kingdom.” That Kingdom
would last forever. Daniel learned another
thrilling detail about the Messianic
Kingdom—the King would share his
rulership with others, a group referred
to as “the holy ones of the Supreme
One.”—Daniel 7:13, 14, 27.
The Kingdom will destroy the governments
of this world. God granted
Daniel the ability to interpret a dream
that baffled Nebuchadnezzar, the king
of Babylon. The king had seen a giant
image with a head of gold, breasts and
arms of silver, belly and thighs of copper,
legs of iron, and feet of iron mixed
with clay. A stone cut from a mountain
struck the fragile feet and crushed
the image to powder. Daniel explained
that the parts of the image represented
a long succession of world powers,
starting with Babylon as the head of
gold. Daniel foresaw that in the time
of the final ruling power of this wicked
world, God’s Kingdom would act. It
would crush all the governments of this
world. Then it would rule forever.—Daniel,
chapter 2.
As a very old man, Daniel lived to see
the fall of Babylon. King Cyrus overthrew
the city just as the prophets had
foretold. Not long afterward, the Jews
were at last freed from their exile—right
on time, after the foretold 70-year desolation
of their homeland. Under the
guidance of faithful governors, priests,
and prophets, the Jews eventually rebuilt
Jerusalem and restored the temple of Jehovah.
What would happen, though, after
the 483 years ran their course?

WOULD Jehovah help people to
identify the promised Messiah?
Yes. Consider what God did. It was some
four centuries after the Hebrew Scriptures
were completed. In a city called
Nazareth, in the northern region of Galilee,
a young woman named Mary received
a most surprising visit. An angel
named Gabriel appeared to her and told
her that God was going to use his active
force, his holy spirit, to cause her to give
birth to a son, though she was a virgin.
This son was to become the longpromised
King, the one who would rule
forever! This child would be God’s own
Son, whose life God would transfer from
the heavens to the womb of Mary.
Mary humbly accepted that awesome
assignment. Her fiancé, a carpenter
named Joseph, married her after God
sent an angel to assure him of the cause
of Mary’s pregnancy. What, though,
about the prophecy saying that the Messiah
would be born in Bethlehem? (Micah
5:2) That small town was some
90 miles away!
A Roman ruler decreed that a census be
taken. People were required to register at
their town of origin. It appears that both
Joseph and Mary had roots in Bethlehem,
so Joseph took his pregnant wife
there. (Luke 2:3) Mary gave birth in a
humble stable, laying the baby in a manger.
God then sent a multitude of angels
to tell a group of shepherds on a hillside
that the child just bornwas the promised
Messiah, or Christ.
Later, others too would testify that
Jesus was the promised Messiah. The
prophet Isaiah had foretold that a man
would arise to prepare the way for the
Messiah’s vital work. (Isaiah 40:3) That
forerunner was John the Baptist. When
he saw the man Jesus, he cried: “See,
the Lamb of God that takes away the
sin of the world!” Some of John’s disciples
immediately followed Jesus. One of
themsaid: “We have found the Messiah.”
—John 1:29, 36, 41.
There was further testimony. When
John baptized Jesus, Jehovah himself
spoke from heaven. By means of holy
spirit, he appointed Jesus as the Messiah
and said: “This is my Son, the beloved,
whom I have approved.” (Matthew 3:16,
17) The long-promised Messiah had arrived!
When did this happen? In the year
29 C.E., just when the 483 years foretold
by Daniel finished running their course.
Yes, that is part of the overwhelming evidence
that Jesus is the Messiah, or Christ.
What message, though, would he proclaim
during his time on the earth?

Luke chapter 2; John chapter 1.

Jehovah is the Father of Jesus—but not in the same
way that men are fathers. Jesus was not conceived by a
woman—he was created by God. In fact, he was the
first person that Jehovah created. (Colossians 1:15-17)
Since Jehovah gave life to Jesus by creating him, He can
be called Jesus’ Father. After creating this spirit Son,
Jehovah used him as “a master worker” to bring all
other things into existence, including the physical
universe.—Proverbs 8:30.
GOD’S SON IN WHAT SENSE?
29 C.E. Jesus begins to preach
about God’s Kingdom
Jesus chooses his 12 apostles; delivers Sermon on the Mount 31
20
WHAT was Jesus’ mission on earth?
He himself said: “I must declare
the good news of the kingdom of God,
because for this I was sent forth.” (Luke
4:43) Consider four things that Jesus
taught about that Kingdom, the central
theme of his preaching.
1. Jesus was designated
King. Jesus directly
said that he was
the foretold Messiah.
(John 4:25, 26) He also
showed that he was the
King that the prophet
Daniel had seen in vision.
Jesus told his apostles
that he would one day sit on a “glorious
throne” and that they too would
sit on thrones. (Matthew 19:28) He referred
to this group of rulers as his
“little flock,” and he also noted that
he had “other sheep,” who were not a
part of that group.—Luke 12:32; John
10:16.
2. God’s Kingdom would promote
true justice. Jesus indicated that the
Kingdomwould do away with the greatest
injustice by sanctifying, or making
holy, the name of Jehovah God and
clearing it of all the reproach that Satan
has heaped upon it since the rebellion in
Eden. (Matthew 6:9, 10) Jesus also demonstrated
impartiality daily by teaching
men and women, rich and poor, without
distinction. Though his mission was
primarily to teach the Israelites, he also
reached out to help Samaritans and Gentiles,
or non-Jews. Unlike the religious
leaders of his day, he showed no trace of
bias or favoritism.
3. God’s Kingdomwould be no part
of this world. Jesus lived during a time
of great upheaval. His homeland was under
the domination of a foreign power.
Yet, when people tried to get him involved
in the political affairs of the day,
he withdrew. (John 6:14, 15) He told one
politician: “My kingdom is no part of this
world.” (John 18:36) To his followers, he
said: “You are no part of the world.”
(John 15:19) He would not allow them to
use weapons of war, even to defend him
personally.—Matthew 26:51, 52.
4. Christ’s rule would be based on
love. Jesus promised to refresh people,
to ease their burdens. (Matthew 11:28-
30) He lived up to his word. He gave loving,
practical counsel on coping with
anxiety, improving relationships, combating
materialism, and finding happiness.
(Matthew, chapters 5-7) Because he
showed love, people from all walks of
life found him approachable. Even the
most downtrodden flocked to him, confident
that he would treat them with
kindness and dignity. What a Ruler Jesus
will be!
There was another very powerful way
in which Jesus taught about God’s Kingdom.
He performed many miracles.
Why did he do so? Let us see.

John.

GOD empowered Jesus to do things
that other humans could not do.
Jesus performed a great many miracles
—often in front of crowds of eyewitnesses.
Those miracles demonstrated that Jesus
has power over enemies and obstacles
that imperfect humans have never
been able to combat with lasting success.
Consider some examples.
Hunger. Jesus’ first miracle involved
turning water into fine wine. On two
other occasions, he fed hungry crowds
of thousands with just a few loaves and
fishes. In both cases, there was more
than enough food for everyone.
Sickness. Jesus cured people having
“every sort of disease and every sort
of infirmity.” (Matthew 4:23) Blindness,
deafness, leprosy, and epilepsy were
cured under his healing touch. He cured
the lame, the crippled, and the maimed
as well. Therewas no formof illness that
proved insurmountable to him.
Dangerous weather. When Jesus and
his disciples were sailing across the Sea
of Galilee, a violent windstorm broke
out. The disciples were terrified. Jesus
simply looked at the storm and
said: “Hush! Be quiet!” At that, a great
calm set in. (Mark 4:37-39) On another
occasion, he walked on the water
during a frightening storm.—Matthew
14:24-33.
Wicked spirits. Wicked spirits are far
stronger than humans. Many people
have proved powerless to break the grip
of these vicious enemies of God. Yet,
again and again, when Jesus ordered
them out, he broke the spirits’ hold on
their victims. He did not fear those spirits.
On the contrary, they
knew his authority and
feared him.
Death. Aptly termed
“the last enemy,” death
is a foe that no human
can defeat. (1 Corinthians
15:26) Yet, Jesus resurrected
the dead, restoring
a young man to his
widowed mother and a
young girl to her grieving
parents. In a most
remarkable instance, Jesus
resurrected his dear
friend Lazarus in front of a crowd of
mourners, although the man had been
dead nearly four days! Even Jesus’ most
determined enemies acknowledged that
he had performed this miracle.—John
11:38-48; 12:9-11.
Why did Jesus performall those miracles?
After all, did not death eventually
claim all those whom he helped?
Yes, but Jesus’ miracles did lasting good.
They proved that all the thrilling prophecies
about the rule of the Messianic
King had a basis in fact. There is
no need to doubt that God’s appointed
King can eradicate hunger, sickness,
dangerous weather, wicked spirits, or
death itself. He has already demonstrated
that God has put all such power in
his hands.
—Based on the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
John.

ON THE Mount of Olives, with a
splendid view of Jerusalem and its
temple below, four of Jesus’ apostles
asked himprivately about some of his remarks.
Jesus had just said that the temple
in Jerusalemwould be destroyed. And on
an earlier occasion, he had told them
about “the conclusion of the system of
things.” (Matthew 13:40, 49) Now the
apostles asked: “What will be the sign of
your presence and of the conclusion of
the system of things?”—Matthew 24:3.
In his answer, Jesus told what would
occur before Jerusalem’s destruction.
But his words were more far-reaching
than that. His prophecy would later
have a larger fulfillment worldwide. Jesus
prophesied about a combination of
events and world conditions that would
form a sign. That sign would show those
on earth that Jesus’ presence as King
in heaven had begun. In other words,
the sign would indicate that Jehovah
God had made Jesus the King of the
long-promised Messianic Kingdom. The
sign would mean that the Kingdom was
about to remove wickedness and bring
true peace to mankind. The things Jesus
foretold would thus mark the last days of
the old system of things—the religious,
political, and social systems that now exist—
and the beginning of a new one.
Explaining what would happen on
earth during his presence as King in
heaven, Jesus said that there would
be international wars, food shortages,
great earthquakes, and widespread disease.
Lawlessness would increase. Jesus’
genuine disciples would preach the good
news of God’s Kingdom in all the earth.
All these things would culminate in
“great tribulation” such as had never occurred
before.—Matthew 24:21.
How would Jesus’ followers know
when that tribulation is near? “Learn
from the fig tree,” said Jesus. (Matthew
24:32) The appearance of fig leaves on
the branches is a noticeable sign that
summer is near. Likewise, the occurrence
within one time period of all the
things Jesus foretold would be a recognizable
sign that the end is near. No one
but the Father would know the exact
day and hour when the great tribulation
would begin. Therefore, Jesus urged
his disciples: “Keep awake, for you do
not know when the appointed time is.”
—Mark 13:33.
—Based on Matthew chapters 24 and 25; Mark chapter
13; Luke chapter 21.

Jesus foretold that there would be a sign to show
that the time is near for God to destroy the present
corrupt system of things. Beginning with World War I,
mankind has witnessed what Jesus prophesied.
Religious, political, and social developments worldwide
are leading quickly and inescapably to the end of this
system of things. Jesus taught his followers that to
survive, they must “keep awake” and act decisively to
put themselves on God’s side of the issue of
sovereignty.—Luke 21:36; Matthew 24:3-14.
 For a further discussion of Jesus’ prophecy, see pages 86-95
of the book What Does the Bible Really Teach? published by
Jehovah’s Witnesses.
THE SIGN OF CHRIST’S PRESENCE
Nisan 30,
33 C.E.
AFTER three and a half years of
preaching and teaching, Jesus knew
that his time on earth was drawing to an
end. The Jewish religious leaders were
conspiring to kill him, but they feared
an uproar among the people, who held
him to be a prophet. Meanwhile, Satan
influenced one of Jesus’ 12 apostles—Judas
Iscariot—to turn traitor. The religious
leaders offered Judas 30 silver coins to
betray Jesus.
On his final night, Jesus gathered with
his apostles to observe the Passover. After
dismissing Judas, he instituted a new
observance, the Lord’s EveningMeal. He
took a loaf of bread, offered a prayer, and
passed the bread to the remaining 11
apostles. “This means my body which is
to be given in your behalf,” he said.
“Keep doing this in remembrance of
me.” He did the same with a cup of
wine, saying: “This cup means the new
covenant by virtue of my blood.”—Luke
22:19, 20.
Jesus had much to say to his apostles
that night. He gave them a new
commandment—that they show unselfish
love to one another. He said: “By this
all will know that you aremy disciples, if
you have love among yourselves.” (John
13:34, 35) He urged them not to let
their hearts be troubled by the tragic
events that were about to unfold. Jesus
prayed earnestly in their behalf. They
sang praises together and went out into
the night.
In the garden of Gethsemane, Jesus
kneeled and poured out his heart in
prayer. Soon, an armed mob of soldiers,
priests, and others arrived to arrest him.
Judas approached and singled Jesus out
by giving him a kiss. As the soldiers
bound Jesus, the apostles fled.
Standing before the Jewish high court,
Jesus identified himself as the Son of
God. The court considered him guilty of
blasphemy and liable to death. Jesus was
then taken to the Roman Governor Pontius
Pilate. Although he found Jesus innocent
of any crime, he turned Jesus
over to the mob clamoring for his death.
Jesus was led to Golgotha, where Roman
soldiers nailed him to a stake.
Broad daylight miraculously turned to
darkness. Later that afternoon, Jesus
died, and a great earthquake occurred.
His body was laid in a tomb cut into the
rock. The next day, priests sealed the
tomb and posted a guard at its entrance.
Was Jesus to remain in that tomb? No.
The greatest of all miracles was about to
occur.

The death of Jesus played a key role in the outworking
of Jehovah’s purpose. Because Jesus was conceived
by means of God’s holy spirit, he was born perfect, not
subject to inherited death. Yet, he gave his life so that
mankind could have the opportunity to live forever and
enjoy the kind of life that disobedient Adam lost for his
descendants.—Matthew 20:28; Luke 1:34, 35; John 3:
16, 36; 2 Peter 3:13.

ON THE third day after Jesus’ death,
certain women who were his disciples
discovered that the stone blocking
the entrance to the tomb had been
rolled away. Furthermore, the tomb was
empty!
Two angels appeared. “You are looking
for Jesus the Nazarene,” one said. “He
was raised up.” (Mark 16:6) Without delay,
the women ran to tell the apostles.
On the way, they met Jesus. “Have no
fear!” he said. “Go, report to my brothers,
that they may go off into Galilee;
and there they will see me.”—Matthew
28:10.
Later that day, two disciples were walking
from Jerusalem to the village of Emmaus.
A stranger joined them and asked
what they were talking about. He was, in
fact, the resurrected Jesus, who appeared
in a form they did not recognize at first.
With sad faces they replied that they had
been speaking about Jesus. The stranger
began to explain things pertaining to the
Messiah in all the Scriptures. Indeed, Jesus
had fulfilled Messianic prophecies
down to the finest detail. When the disciples
realized that the stranger was Je-

sus, who had been resurrected as a spirit,
he disappeared.
The two disciples immediately returned
to Jerusalem. There they found
the apostles gathered behind locked
doors. While the two related their experience,
Jesus appeared. His astonished
followers could hardly believe it! “Why
is it doubts come up in your hearts?” Jesus
asked. “It is written that the Christ
would suffer and rise from among the
dead on the third day.”—Luke 24:38, 46.
For 40 days after his resurrection, Jesus
appeared to his disciples on different
occasions. In one case, he appeared to
more than 500! Likely on this occasion,
he gave them this weighty assignment:
“Go . . . and make disciples of people of
all the nations, . . . teaching them to observe
all the things I have commanded
you. And, look! I am with you all the
days until the conclusion of the system
of things.”—Matthew 28:19, 20.
At his last meeting with his 11 faithful
apostles, Jesus promised: “You will receive
power when the holy spirit arrives
upon you, and you will be witnesses of
me . . . to the most distant part of the
earth.” (Acts 1:8) Then Jesus was lifted
up, and a cloud blocked their view of
him as he ascended to heaven.

God’s holy spirit is the most powerful force in the
universe. Jehovah God used his spirit, or active force, to
create the heavens and the earth and to guide the
writing of the Bible. This spirit was the force behind all
the miracles we have read about thus far, including the
greatest one of all—the resurrection of Jesus Christ to
life as a mighty spirit.—Genesis 1:2; 2 Samuel 23:2; Acts
10:38; 1 Peter 3:18.

TEN days after Jesus ascended to
heaven, about 120 of his disciples
gathered in a house in Jerusalem at the
time of the Jewish Festival of Pentecost,
33 C.E. Suddenly, a noise like that of a
rushing breeze filled the house. The disciples
miraculously began speaking in
languages that they did not know. What
could explain these strange events? God
had given holy spirit to the disciples.
Outside, there was a crowd because
visitors had come from many lands
for the festival. They were astounded
to hear their own languages being
spoken fluently by Jesus’ disciples. Explaining
what had happened, Peter referred
to the prophet Joel’s prophecy
that God would “pour out” his spirit,
which would impart miraculous gifts to
those receiving it. (Joel 2:28, 29) This
powerful evidence of holy spirit made it
clear that an important change had occurred:
God’s favor had shifted from Israel
to the newly formed Christian congregation.
Those who wanted to serve
God acceptably now had to become followers
of Christ.
Meanwhile, opposition grew, and enemies
threw the disciples into prison.
But during the night, Jehovah’s angel
opened the prison doors and told the
disciples to continue preaching. At daybreak,
they did just that. They entered
the temple and began to teach the good
news about Jesus. Their religious opposers
were furious and ordered them to
stop preaching. Undaunted, the apostles
replied: “We must obey God as ruler
rather than men.”—Acts 5:28, 29.
Persecution escalated. Certain Jews accused
the disciple Stephen of blasphemy
and stoned him to death. A young man
—Saul of Tarsus—looked on, approving
of the murder. He then went to Damascus
to arrest anyone who followed
Christ. As Saul traveled on the road, a
light from heaven flashed around him
and a voice said: “Saul, Saul, why are you
persecuting me?” Blinded by the light,
Saul asked: “Who are you?” The voice
answered: “I am Jesus.”—Acts 9:3-5.
Three days later, Jesus sent a disciple
named Ananias to restore Saul’s sight.
Saul was baptized and began preaching
boldly about Jesus. Saul came to be
known as the apostle Paul and became a
zealous member of the Christian congregation.
Jesus’ disciples had been declaring the
good news of the Kingdom of God to
Jews and Samaritans only. An angel now
appeared to Cornelius, a God-fearing Roman
army officer, telling him to send
for the apostle Peter. Accompanied by
others, Peter preached to Cornelius and
his household. While Peter was speaking,
holy spirit came upon those Gentile
believers, and the apostle directed that
they be baptized in the name of Jesus.
Theway to everlasting lifewas now open
to people of all nations. The congregation
was poised to spread the good news
far and wide.

FOLLOWING his conversion, Paul eagerly
declared the good news about
God’s Kingdom—only now the onetime
opposer himself often faced bitter opposition.
This tireless apostle made several
preaching tours, traveling far and wide to
spread the good news about the Kingdom
that will fulfill God’s original purpose
for humankind.
In Lystra, during his first preaching
tour, Paul healed a man lame from birth.
The crowds began crying out that Paul
and his traveling companion Barnabas
were gods. The two men could scarcely
restrain the people from offering sacrifices
to them. Influenced by Paul’s enemies,
however, these same crowds later
stoned Paul and left him for dead. Paul
survived the attack and in time returned
to that city to strengthen the disciples
with encouraging words.
Some Jewish Christians argued that
non-Jewish believers had to adhere to
portions of the Law of Moses. Paul took
the question to the apostles and older
men in Jerusalem. After careful consideration
of the Scriptures and with the guidance
of God’s holy spirit, those men
wrote to the congregations and admonished
them to abstain from idolatry, from
eating blood and unbled meat, and from
fornication. Such commands were “necessary
things,” but heeding these did not
require following the Mosaic Law.—Acts
15:28, 29.
On his second preaching journey, Paul
visited Beroea, now in modern-day
Greece. Jews living there received the
word eagerly, examining the Scriptures
daily to verify his teaching. Once again,
opposition forced him to move on, this
time to Athens. Before a learned group of
Athenians, Paul gave a powerful speech
that is a model of tact, discernment, and
eloquence.
After a third preaching trip, Paul went
to Jerusalem. When he visited the temple
there, certain Jews started a riot, wanting
to kill him. Roman soldiers intervened
and interrogated Paul. As a Roman citizen,
he later made his defense before Roman
Governor Felix. The Jews could present
no evidence for the charges they
brought against Paul. To prevent Festus,
another Roman governor, from handing
him over to the Jews, Paul said: “I appeal
to Caesar!” Festus replied: “To Caesar you
shall go.”—Acts 25:11, 12.
Paul was then taken by boat to Italy to
stand trial. Shipwrecked on that voyage,
he had to winter on the island of Malta.
When he finally arrived in Rome, he
stayed for two years in a rented house.
Even though he was under soldier guard,
the ever zealous apostle continued to
preach about the Kingdom of God to all
who visited him.

THE newly established
Chr ist ian congregation
would have an
important role in the fulfillment
of Jehovah’s purpose.
But the first-century
Christians quickly came
under attack. Would they
keep their integrity to
God in the face of persecution
from without and
other more subtle dangers
from within? The Christian
Greek Scriptures contain
21 letters that offered
needed counsel and encouragement.
Fourteen of the letters
—from Romans to Hebrews—were
penned by the apostle Paul. These letters
are named after those to whom they are
addressed—whether an individual or the
members of a particular congregation.
Consider some of the subjects covered
in Paul’s letters.
Admonition on morals and conduct.
Those who practice fornication,
adultery, and other gross sins “will not
inherit God’s kingdom.” (Galatians 5:
19-21; 1 Corinthians 6:9-11) Worshippers
of God must be united regardless
of nationality. (Romans 2:11; Ephesians
4:1-6) They should cheerfully give of
themselves to help fellow believers in
need. (2 Corinthians 9:7) “Pray incessantly,”
Paul says. Indeed, worshippers
are encouraged to pour out their hearts
to Jehovah in prayer. (1 Thessalonians 5:
17; 2 Thessalonians 3:1; Philippians 4:
6, 7) For prayers to be heard by God,
they must be offered in faith.—Hebrews
11:6.
What will help families to thrive?
Husbands should love their wives as
their own bodies. Wives should have
deep respect for their husbands. Children
should obey their parents, for this
is pleasing to God. Parents need to guide
and train their children lovingly, using
godly principles.—Ephesians 5:22–
6:4; Colossians 3:18-21.
Light shed on God’s purpose. Many
aspects of the Mosaic Law served to
safeguard and guide the Israelites until
the arrival of Christ. (Galatians 3:
24) Christians, however, do not need to
observe that Law in order to worship
God. In writing to the Hebrews—Christians
of Jewish background—Paul shed
much light on the meaning of the Law
and on how God’s purpose is fulfilled
in Christ. Paul explained that various

arrangements under that Law had prophetic
value. For example, the sacrificing
of animals foreshadowed Jesus’ sacrificial
death, which would accomplish true
forgiveness of sins. (Hebrews 10:1-4) By
means of the death of Jesus, God canceled
that Law covenant, for it was no
longer needed.—Colossians 2:13-17; Hebrews
8:13.
Direction on proper congregation
organization. Men willing to handle responsibilities
in the congregation must
have high moral standards and meet spiritual
qualifications. (1 Timothy 3:1-10,
12, 13; Titus 1:5-9) Worshippers of Jehovah
God should regularly gather with fellow
believers to encourage one another.
(Hebrews 10:24, 25) Meetings
for worship should be
upbuilding and instructive.
—1 Corinthians 14:26, 31.
By the time Paul wrote
the second of his two letters
to Timothy, the apostle
was back in Rome; he was
imprisoned, awaiting judgment.
Only a courageous
few risked visiting him. Paul knew that
his time was short. “I have fought the
fine fight,” he said. “I have run the
course to the finish, I have observed the
faith.” (2 Timothy 4:7) Likely Paul suffered
martyrdom shortly thereafter. But
the apostle’s letters guide true worshippers
of God to this day.

After Adam and Eve sinned, God used symbolic
language when he said to the serpent: “I shall
put enmity between you and the woman and
between your seed and her seed. He will bruise
you in the head and you will bruise him in the
heel.” (Genesis 3:15) The Scriptures identify the
Devil as “the original serpent.” (Revelation 12:9)
The identity of God’s promised Seed, or Deliverer,
was a secret that over the centuries was revealed
progressively in the Bible.
Some 2,000 years after Adam and Eve sinned,
Jehovah indicated that the promised Seed would
come through Abraham’s lineage. (Genesis 22:17,
18) Centuries later, the apostle Paul revealed that
the primary part of the Seed is the Messiah, Jesus
Christ. (Galatians 3:16) In harmony with Genesis
3:15, Jesus was figuratively bruised “in the heel”
when he was put to death. However, God
resurrected Jesus, who was “made alive in the
spirit.”—1 Peter 3:18.
God also purposed that 144,000 humans
would become a secondary part of the seed.
(Galatians 3:29; Revelation 14:1) They are
resurrected to spirit life as joint heirs with Christ
in the heavenly Kingdom.—Romans 8:16, 17.
As a mighty King in heaven, Jesus will soon
do away with the Devil and his seed—the wicked
humans and demons who follow Satan. (John 8:
44; Ephesians 6:12) The rule of Jesus will bring
peace and joy to all obedient mankind. He will
thus eventually bruise the serpent “in the head,”
crushing him out of existence.—Hebrews 2:14.

JAMES and Jude were half brothers of
Jesus. Peter and John were among Jesus’
12 apostles. Those four men wrote a
total of seven letters that are found in
the Christian Greek Scriptures. Each of
the letters bears the name of its writer.
The inspired admonition found in these
letters was intended to help Christians
maintain integrity to Jehovah and keep
God’s Kingdom in view.
Manifest faith. Merely professing to
have faith is not enough. True faith leads
to action. “Indeed,” writes James, “faith
without works is dead.” (James 2:26) Acting
in faith when facing trials builds endurance.
To succeed, a Christian needs to
ask God for wisdom, convinced that God
will give it to him. Endurance leads to
God’s approval. (James 1:2-6, 12) If in
faith a worshipper maintains integrity,
Jehovah God will respond. “Draw close
to God,” James says, “and he will draw
close to you.”—James 4:8.
A Christian’s faith must be strong
enough to help him resist temptations
and immoral influences. A prevailing
bad moral environment compelled Jude
to urge his fellow believers to “put up a
hard fight for the faith.”—Jude 3.
Maintain clean conduct. Jehovah
expects his worshippers to be holy, that
is, clean in all respects. Peter writes: “Become
holy yourselves in all your conduct,
because it is written: ‘You must be
holy, because I [Jehovah] am holy.’ ”
(1 Peter 1:15, 16) Christians have an
example worth imitating. “Christ suffered
for you,” says Peter, “leaving you a
model for you to follow his steps closely.”
(1 Peter 2:21) Although Christians
may suffer because they hold to God’s
standards, they preserve “a good conscience.”
(1 Peter 3:16, 17) Peter urges
Christians to abound in holy conduct
and deeds that reflect godly devotion
while awaiting God’s day of judgment
and the promised new world in which
“righteousness is to dwell.”—2 Peter 3:
11-13.
Demonstrate love. “God is love,”
writes John. The apostle points out
that God demonstrated his great love
by sending forth Jesus as
a “sacrifice for our sins.”
How should Christians respond?
John explains: “Beloved
ones, if this is how
God loved us, then we are
ourselves under obligation
to love one another.” (1 John 4:8-11)
One way to show such love is by being
hospitable to fellow believers.—3 John
5-8.
How, though, can worshippers of Jehovah
demonstrate their love for him?
John answers: “This is what the love
of God means, that we observe his
commandments; and yet his commandments
are not burdensome.” (1 John
5:3; 2 John 6) Those who thus obey God
are assured that they will continue to be
loved by God “with everlasting life in
view.”—Jude 21.

THE last book of the Bible, called Revelation
or Apocalypse, provides all
mankind with hope. Recorded by the
apostle John, the book contains visions
that climax in the fulfillment of Jehovah’s
purpose.
In the first vision, the resurrected Jesus
commends and corrects a number of
congregations. The next vision takes us
before God’s heavenly throne, where spirit
creatures are offering him praise.
As God’s purpose moves forward, the
Lamb, Jesus Christ, receives a scroll with
seven seals. With the opening of the
first four seals, symbolic horsemen charge
onto the world scene. The first is Jesus on
a white horse and crowned as King. Next
come riders on different-colored horses,
prophetically representing war, famine,
and pestilence—all of which take place
during the last days of this system of
things. The opening of the seventh seal
leads to the blowing of seven symbolic
trumpets, denoting proclamations of
God’s judgments. These lead to seven
symbolic plagues, or expressions of God’s
anger.
God’s Kingdom, depicted as a newborn
male child, is established in heaven. War
breaks out, and Satan and his wicked angels
are cast down to the earth. “Woe for
the earth,” says a loud voice. The Devil
has great anger, knowing he has a short
period of time.—Revelation 12:12.
John sees Jesus in heaven represented
as a lamb, and with him 144,000 who
are chosen from among mankind. These
ones “will rule as kings with” Jesus. Revelation
thus reveals that the secondary
members of the seed will total 144,000 in
number.—Revelation 14:1; 20:6.
The rulers of the earth gather to Armageddon,
“the war of the great day of
God the Almighty.” They wage war with
the one seated on the white horse—Jesus,
who leads heavenly armies. All the rulers
of this world are destroyed. Satan is
bound, and Jesus and the 144,000 reign
over the earth for “a thousand years.” At
the end of the thousand years, Satan is
destroyed.—Revelation 16:14; 20:4.
What will the Millennial Reign of
Christ and his corulers mean for obedient
humans? John writes: “[Jehovah]
will wipe out every tear from their eyes,
and death will be no more, neither will
mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.
The former things have passed
away.” (Revelation 21:4) The earth becomes
a paradise!
The book of Revelation thus completes
the Bible’s message. By means of the Messianic
Kingdom, Jehovah’s name is sanctified
and his sovereignty completely vindicated
for all eternity!

? Revelation
In the book of Revelation, all false religions—that is,
religions that stand in opposition to the true God—are
collectively identified as “the great harlot.” She is called
“Babylon the Great,” and she sells, or prostitutes,
herself to the world’s political powers. At Jehovah
God’s appointed time, says Revelation, these powers
will turn on this harlot and destroy her.—Revelation 17:
1-5, 16, 17.
“BABYLON THE GREAT”
The Bible’s Message
A N O V E R V I E W
1Jehovah creates Adam and Eve
with the prospect of eternal life in
Paradise. Satan slanders God’s name
and questions His right to rule. Adam
and Eve join Satan in rebellion, bringing
sin and death upon themselves
and their offspring
2Jehovah sentences
the rebels and
promises that a Deliverer,
or Seed, will arise
whowill crush Satan,
undoing all the results
of rebellion and sin
3Jehovah promises Abraham
and David that they
will be forefathers of the
Seed, or Messiah, whowill
rule as King forever
4Jehovah inspires prophets
to foretell that the
Messiah will provide a cure
for sin and death. With corulers,
he will reign as King
of God’s Kingdom, which
will end wars, sickness, even
death
5Jehovah sends his
Son to the earth and
identifies Jesus as the Messiah.
Jesus preaches about God’s
Kingdom and offers up his life as
a sacrifice. Jehovah then resurrects
him as a spirit
6Jehovah enthrones
his Son as King in heaven,
signaling the beginning of the
last days of this system of things.
Jesus guides his earthly followers
as they preach God’s
Kingdom earth
wide
7Jehovah directs his Son to bring
Kingdom rule to the earth. The Kingdom
crushes all wicked governments,
establishes Paradise, and brings faithful
humans to perfection. Jehovah’s right
to rule is vindicated, and his name
is sanctified forever
