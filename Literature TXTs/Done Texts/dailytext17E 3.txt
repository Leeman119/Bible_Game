How to Use This Booklet
On the following pages, you will ?nd a scripture for each day
and comments on that text. Although the text and comments
may be read at any time, many ?nd it advantageous to consider them in the morning. Then they can re?ect on such thoughts
throughout the day. Discussing the text as a family is most
bene?cial. Bethel families around the world do so at breakfast
time.
The comments are taken from the Watchtower (w) issues of
April 2015 through March 2016. Figures following the date of the
Watchtower issue refer to the number, in order, of each study article (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) that appears in that issue. This is followed
by the paragraphs where the material is found. (See illustration below.) Additional information on the subject matter can
be found in the article itself. To ?nd where each article starts,
see the ?rst or second page of that issue of The Watchtower.

The things you heard from me . . .
entrust to faithful men, who, in
turn, will be adequately quali?ed
to teach others.—2 Tim. 2:2.
Circuit overseers around the
world have noted that in many congregations, more needs to be done
to train brothers—younger and older—to help care for the ?ock. This
presents a challenge. Why is that
the case? If you are a Christian elder, you no doubt realize that
personal training is important. You
know that more brothers are needed to keep existing congregations
spiritually strong and to allow new
congregations to be formed. (Isa.
60:22) You also know that God’s
Word urges you to “teach others.” Even so, you may ?nd it hard
to do so. After you have taken care
of family needs, job requirements,
congregation responsibilities, and
other urgent matters, there just
seems to be no time left to train others in the congregation. Yet, training is needed in order for them to
share the workload. And as that is
accomplished, everyone will bene?t. w15 4/15 1:2, 3

Monday, January 2
Timothy . . . is my beloved and
faithful child in the Lord. He will
remind you of my methods.
—1 Cor. 4:17.
A newly appointed brother should
not feel that as soon as he receives
some responsibility in the congregation, he needs to use it to change
course—to do things in a way that
is completely di?erent from the way
they were done before. The need for
change is determined, not by one’s
desire for change, but by the needs
of the congregation and the direc-

tion we receive from Jehovah’s organization. So if you are appointed,
reassure your fellow believers and
show respect for experienced elders by continuing to use their
Bible-based methods. However,
as you gain experience, you will
no doubt share in applying changes that will help the congregation to
stay in tune with Jehovah’s progressive organization. In fact, Jehovah
may in time move all you faithful
learners to do even greater works
than those of your teachers.—John
14:12. w15 4/15 2:17

Tuesday, January 3
I will give you insight and instruct
you in the way you should go. I will
give you advice with my eye upon
you.—Ps. 32:8.
When under severe hardship, you
may feel as did Paul—that you are
in or at least very near “the lion’s mouth.” (2 Tim. 4:17) These are
times when trust in Jehovah is most
challenging—and most essential.
For example, suppose you are nursing a dear family member through
a chronic illness. Perhaps you have
prayed for wisdom and strength.
Having done all you can in this regard, do you not ?nd a measure of
peace in knowing that Jehovah has
his eye upon you and will provide
what you need to endure faithfully?
Circumstances might make it seem
otherwise. You might receive con?icting opinions from doctors. Or
relatives who you had hoped would
provide comfort might instead
seem to make the situation more
di?cult for you. Keep looking to Jehovah for strength. Keep drawing
close to him. (1 Sam. 30:3, 6) When
relief comes, your relationship with
him will be stronger. w15 4/15 4:10, 11

Wednesday, January 4
Take your stand against [Satan].
—1 Pet. 5:9.
As servants of Jehovah, we
are not among those who are misled into thinking that Satan does
not exist. We know that the Devil is
real, for it was Satan who spoke to
Eve through a serpent. (Gen. 3:1-5)
Satan taunted Jehovah regarding
Job. (Job 1:9-12) It was Satan who
tried to tempt Jesus. (Matt. 4:1-10)
And after the birth of God’s Kingdom in 1914, it was Satan who began “to wage war” with the remnant
of anointed ones. (Rev. 12:17) That
war still rages as Satan seeks to destroy the faith of the remnant of the
144,000 and the other sheep. To win
the battle, we must take our stand
against Satan and remain ?rm in
the faith. Satan is anything but
humble. In fact, for a spirit creature
to have the audacity to challenge
Jehovah’s sovereignty and set himself up as a rival god is the epitome of pride and presumptuousness.
Therefore, one way that we can take
a stand against Satan is by shunning pride and cultivating humility.
—1 Pet. 5:5. w15 5/15 2:3, 4

Thursday, January 5
Jehovah will wipe away the tears
from all faces.—Isa. 25:8.
As Christians we are encouraged
by visualizing our hope, whether it
is heavenly or earthly. Can you see
yourself enjoying the things that
God has promised? Contemplating
what you may do as God ful?lls his
promises undoubtedly brings joy to
your heart. Perhaps you “see” yourself living on earth forever. Think
about cooperating with others in
making this globe into a paradise.
Your neighbors love Jehovah, even

as you do. You are healthy, energetic, and have a bright outlook. Those
supervising the work of restoration
make life a pleasure because they
genuinely care about you. And you
are happy using your talents and
skills because everything you do
is bene?ting others and honoring
God. For example, you are helping
newly resurrected ones to come to
know Jehovah. (John 17:3; Acts 24:
15) No, this is not a dreamworld.
This appealing mental picture is
based on Scriptural truths about
the future.—Isa. 11:9; 33:24; 35:5-7;
65:22. w15 5/15 3:15

Friday, January 6
The director of the feast tasted the
water that had now been turned
into wine.—John 2:9.
Jesus miraculously provided a
large amount of ?ne wine, enough
for a sizable group. (John 2:6-11)
It is of interest that when the Devil tempted Jesus to turn stones into
loaves of bread, Christ refused to
use his miraculous power to satisfy his personal desires. (Matt. 4:2-4)
But he did use his power to respond
to and satisfy the needs of others.
How can we imitate Jesus’ unsel?sh
concern for others? He encouraged
God’s servants to “practice giving.”
(Luke 6:38) Can we show the noble
quality of generosity by inviting
others to our home to share a meal
and a spiritual feast? Can we be generous with our time after a meeting, aiding someone in need, such
as by listening to a brother practice his talk? What help might we be
able to o?er to those needing assistance in the ministry? We show that
we have learned from Jesus by generously providing material and spiritual things to others as we are able.
w15 6/15 1:3, 4, 6

Saturday, January 7
No resident will say: “I am sick.”
—Isa. 33:24.
If we maintain our Christian integrity, we may well witness one of
the greatest miracles of all time
—the miracle of surviving the great
tribulation. Soon after the war of
Armageddon, more miracles will occur, restoring humans to good
health. (Isa. 35:5, 6; Rev. 21:4)
Imagine watching people discard
eyeglasses, canes, crutches, wheelchairs, hearing aids, and the like.
Armageddon survivors will have
work to do. They can move forward
with zest to make our planet, a gift
from God, into a global paradise.
(Ps. 115:16) Jesus’ healings in the
past encourage the “great crowd”
today, reinforcing their joyous prospect of being healed of all ills. (Rev.
7:9) Those healings re?ected his
deep feelings and showed just how
much love God’s ?rstborn Son has
for mankind. (John 10:11; 15:12, 13)
Jesus’ compassion paints a touching portrait of Jehovah’s concern
for each one of his servants.—John
5:19. w15 6/15 2:16, 17

Sunday, January 8
Woe for the earth and for the sea,
because the Devil has come down
to you, having great anger, knowing that he has a short period of
time.—Rev. 12:12.
In 1914, war broke out between nations of Europe—a war that spread
and engulfed the whole world.
By the time it ended in 1918, terrible food shortages had been experienced and there was a ?u epidemic in which more people died
than were killed in the war. Thus

“the sign” that Jesus had given to
identify his invisible presence as
earth’s new King started to be ful?lled. (Matt. 24:3-8; Luke 21:10, 11)
Ample evidence points to the
year 1914 as the time when “a
crown was given” to the Lord Jesus Christ. He “went out conquering
and to complete his conquest.” (Rev.
6:2) He cleansed the heavens in a
war against Satan and his demons,
who were hurled down to the vicinity of the earth. Ever since, mankind
has experienced the truthfulness of
the inspired words of today’s text.
w15 6/15 4:13

Monday, January 9
I will move on to supernatural visions and revelations of the Lord.
—2 Cor. 12:1.
Less than a century after the
Christian congregation was established, a foretold apostasy began to
develop. (Acts 20:28-30; 2 Thess. 2:
3, 4) Thereafter, it became increasingly di?cult to identify who was
truly serving God at his spiritual
temple. Only centuries later did the
time arrive for Jehovah to clarify
matters by means of his newly enthroned King, Jesus Christ. By 1919,
those approved by Jehovah and
serving at his spiritual temple were
clearly identi?ed. They had been
spiritually re?ned in order to make
their service to God even more acceptable to him. (Isa. 4:2, 3; Mal. 3:
1-4) What the apostle Paul had foreseen centuries before in a vision began to be ful?lled in a limited way.
We ?nd Paul’s vision described at
2 Corinthians 12:2-4. What Paul saw
in a supernatural vision was referred to as a revelation. It involved
a future event, not something that
existed in his day. w15 7/15 1:6-8

Tuesday, January 10
At that time the righteous ones will
shine as brightly as the sun in the
Kingdom of their Father.
—Matt. 13:43.
Does this mean that there will be
a “rapture” of the anointed ones?
Many in Christendom believe, according to this teaching, that Christians will be bodily caught up from
the earth. Then, they expect that
Jesus will visibly return to rule the
earth. However, the Bible clearly
shows that “the sign of the Son of
man” will appear in heaven and that
Jesus will come “on the clouds of
heaven.” (Matt. 24:30) Both of these
expressions imply invisibility. Additionally, “?esh and blood cannot
inherit God’s Kingdom.” So those
who will be taken to heaven will ?rst
need to be “changed, in a moment,
in the blink of an eye, during the last
trumpet.” (1 Cor. 15:50-53) Therefore, while we do not use the term
“rapture” here because of its wrong
connotation, the remaining faithful
anointed will be gathered together
in an instant of time. w15 7/15 2:14, 15

Wednesday, January 11
In the midst of the congregation I
will praise you.—Ps. 22:22.
A Kingdom Hall is the center of
pure worship for the local community. Among the provisions that Jehovah makes for our spiritual nourishment are the weekly meetings at
the Kingdom Hall. It is here that we
receive vital spiritual refreshment
and direction through his organization. Even though we have a standing invitation to eat at “the table of
Jehovah,” we must never take that
invitation for granted. (1 Cor. 10:

21) Jehovah considers such occasions for worship and mutual encouragement so important that he
inspired the apostle Paul to urge
us not to forsake our meeting together. (Heb. 10:24, 25) Would we be
showing respect for Jehovah if we
missed Christian meetings for unnecessary reasons? Indeed, we can
show how much we appreciate Jehovah and his provisions by preparing for and wholeheartedly participating in these meetings. w15 7/15
4:3, 4

Thursday, January 12
Keep on the watch.
—Matt. 24:42.
That admonition in itself is
a good reason to remain in expectation—Jesus told us to do so!
In this regard, Jehovah’s organization has set an example. Its publications have consistently exhorted
us to “await and keep close in mind
the presence of the day of Jehovah”
and to ?x our hope on God’s promised new world. (2 Pet. 3:11-13) Although keeping in expectation
was appropriate for Christians living centuries ago, it is particularly important for us. Why? Because
we are living during Christ’s presence. The sign of his presence has
been in evidence since 1914. And the
multifeatured sign, which includes
worsening world conditions and
global Kingdom preaching, means
that we are living in “the conclusion
of the system of things.” (Matt. 24:
3, 7-14) Since Jesus did not say how
long that period of time would go
on before the end arrived, we need
to be especially vigilant, watchful.
w15 8/15 2:4, 5

Friday, January 13
Find exquisite delight in Jehovah.
—Ps. 37:4.
In the new world, we will derive the greatest pleasure from having our spiritual need ?lled. (Matt.
5:3) Spiritual activities will be our
highest priority, and we will demonstrate that we are ?nding exquisite
delight in Jehovah. By giving spiritual things priority now, we are preparing for the real life in the future.
(Matt. 6:19-21) How can we increase
our joy in theocratic activities? One
way is by setting spiritual goals. If
you are young and are giving serious consideration to a career in Jehovah’s service, why not review
some of the material that has been
published about various avenues of
the full-time ministry and set one of
these as a goal? You might talk with
some who have spent many years in
the full-time service. By making the
ministry your career, you are preparing for continued service to God
in the new world, where your theocratic training and experience will
be of great value. w15 8/15 3:13, 14

Saturday, January 14
The fruitage of the spirit is love.
—Gal. 5:22.
Other aspects of the fruitage of
the spirit—such as mildness, selfcontrol, and patience—are important too. (Gal. 5:23) They can help a
mature Christian to handle di?cult
situations without becoming irritated and to endure heartbreaking disappointments without losing hope.
In his program of personal study, he
continually searches for Scriptural
principles that can help him to distinguish right from wrong. There-

after, when he makes decisions, he
gives evidence of spiritual maturity.
For instance, he listens to his Bibletrained conscience. The mature
Christian shows humility in that he
recognizes that Jehovah’s ways and
standards are always better than
his own. He zealously preaches the
good news and contributes to the
unity of the congregation. No matter how long we have been serving
Jehovah, each of us can ask, ‘Are
there areas where I yet should model myself more closely after Jesus,
thus continuing to progress spiritually?’ w15 9/15 1:6, 7

Sunday, January 15
You with little faith, why did you
give way to doubt?—Matt. 14:31.
The disciples see Jesus walking
on the Sea of Galilee. Peter calls out
to Jesus, asking if he could walk
across the water to his Master. When
Jesus tells him to come, Peter gets
out of the boat and miraculously
walks toward Jesus on the choppy
surface. Moments later, though, Peter starts to sink. Why? He looked at
the windstorm and became afraid.
Peter cries out to Jesus, who quickly catches hold of him and says the
words quoted above. (Matt. 14:2432) When Peter climbed out of the
boat to walk on the water, he did
so in faith. Jesus had called him,
and Peter trusted that God’s power
would support him just as it was supporting Jesus. Similarly, when we
dedicated ourselves to Jehovah and
got baptized, we did so because of
our faith. Jesus called us to be his
followers, to walk in his footsteps.
We had to exercise faith in both
Jesus and God, trusting that they
would support us in various ways.
—John 14:1; 1 Pet. 2:21. w15 9/15 3:1, 3

Monday, January 16
He is guarding the lives of his loyal ones; he rescues them from the
hand of the wicked.—Ps. 97:10.
Certainly, one of a loving father’s
priorities is that of protecting and
safeguarding his family against any
possible harm or serious danger.
Jehovah, our heavenly Father, does
no less. Consider an example. How
precious your eyes are to you! That
is how Jehovah feels about his people. (Zech. 2:8) How precious God’s
people are to him! Jehovah has on
occasion allowed enemies to take
the life of a faithful one, such as Stephen. Yet, God protects his people
overall by providing timely warnings against Satan’s crafty acts.
(Eph. 6:10-12) Through his Word
and Bible-based publications from
his organization, we are helped to
see the truth about deceptive riches, immoral and violent entertainment, misuse of the Internet, and so
on. Clearly, as a loving Father, Jehovah looks after the safety and wellbeing of his people. w15 9/15 4:15, 17

The hand of Jehovah is not too
short to save.—Isa. 59:1.
The fact that Jehovah’s Witnesses
have been successful in “defending
and legally establishing” the good
news is proof of support from Jehovah’s mighty hand. (Phil. 1:7) Some
governments have tried to stop the
work of God’s people completely.
But when we look back and see that
Jehovah’s Witnesses have received
at least 268 high-court victories, including 24 cases won in the European Court of Human Rights

just since the year 2000, it becomes
clear that no one can hold back
God’s hand. (Isa. 54:17) The preaching of the good news worldwide is
accomplished only with God’s help.
(Matt. 24:14; Acts 1:8) Add to that
the uni?ed, multinational brotherhood of Jehovah’s people today
—something the world cannot imitate—and we can see why even outsiders admit: “God is really among
you.” (1 Cor. 14:25) So as a whole,
we have abundant proof that God
is working in behalf of his people.
—Isa. 66:14. w15 10/15 1:13, 14

Do not love . . . the things in the
world.—1 John 2:15.
There is a danger in making too
much use of what the world has
to o?er. (1 Cor. 7:29-31) A Christian
can easily waste an excessive
amount of time on things that are
not wrong in themselves, such as
hobbies, recreational reading, TV
watching, sightseeing, window
shopping, and seeking out the latest
electronic gadgets or luxuries. Social networking, texting, circulating
e-mails, and frequently checking
the latest news and sports events
can also waste our time and can
even become an obsession. (Eccl.
3:1, 6) If we do not limit the amount
of time we spend on nonessential
things, we may ?nd ourselves neglecting the most important activity of all—our worship of Jehovah.
(Eph. 5:15-17) Satan has designed
his world to attract and distract
us. That was true in the ?rst century, and it is even more so today.
(2 Tim. 4:10) Thus, we need to heed
the counsel of today’s text. w15 10/15

Instruct us about what we
should do.—Judg. 13:8.
Manoah and his wife were going
to have a son! No doubt, Manoah
was happy, but he was also aware of
the great responsibility that rested
on his shoulders. In a nation
?lled with badness, how could he
and his wife successfully raise their
son to serve God? Manoah “pleaded with Jehovah,” saying: “Please
let the man of the true God [the angel] whom you just sent come again
to instruct us about what we should
do with the child who will be
born.” (Judg. 13:1-8) If you are a parent, you can likely relate to Manoah’s earnest plea. You too bear the
weighty responsibility of helping
your child to come to know and love
Jehovah. (Prov. 1:8) To that end,
Christian parents arrange for a
meaningful and progressive Family
Worship program. Of course, to impress Bible truths on a child’s mind,
you need to do more than conduct
a weekly family study. (Deut. 6:6-9)
Can you meet the challenge of inculcating the truth in your child?
w15 11/15 1:1, 2

Friday, January 20
See, truly an Israelite in whom
there is no deceit.—John 1:47.
You cannot read hearts as Jesus
could, but with God’s help you can
exercise insight. Will you use that
ability to look for the good in your
teenager? No one wants to be labeled a “troublemaker.” In thought
or word, never label your son or
daughter a “rebellious teenager” or
a “problem child.” Even if your teen
is struggling, let him know that you
see his potential and heartfelt desire to do what is right. Note any

signs of growth and progress, and
commend him. Help him to develop
his good qualities by giving him increased responsibility when possible. Jesus did that with his disciples. About a year and a half after
meeting Nathanael, Jesus selected him as an apostle, and Nathanael proved to be a zealous Christian.
(Luke 6:13, 14; Acts 1:13, 14) Your
commendation and encouragement
will help your child to feel that he
is, not someone who always fails to
measure up, but a capable Christian
whom Jehovah can use. w15 11/15 2:

They are rendering [God] sacred
service day and night.—Rev. 7:15.
When the last days began in 1914,
there were only a few thousand servants of Jehovah worldwide. Motivated by love for neighbor, and
with the backing of God’s spirit, a
small remnant of anointed Christians persevered in the Kingdompreaching work. As a result, today
a great crowd with an earthly hope
is being gathered. Our ranks have
grown to about 8,000,000 Witnesses associated with more than 115,400 congregations throughout the
earth, and we continue to grow in
number. For example, over 275,500
new Witnesses were baptized during the 2014 service year—an average of some 5,300 each week. The
remarkable growth that we see today is the result of our faith in God
and full acceptance of the Bible
—Jehovah’s miraculously inspired
Word. (1 Thess. 2:13) Especially outstanding is the spiritual prosperity
of Jehovah’s people—despite the hatred and opposition of Satan, “the
god of this system of things.”—2 Cor.
4:4. w15 11/15 4:12, 14, 16

Sunday, January 22
The word of our God endures
forever.—Isa. 40:8.
Thousands of fragments, manuscripts, and ancient translations
have been compared and painstakingly studied by Bible scholars.
This study validated the contents of
the vast majority of Bible passages. The few verses about which
there is a degree of uncertainty do
not change the overall message. A
study of ancient manuscripts convinces sincere Bible students that
they have what Jehovah originally inspired Bible writers to record.
Despite ?erce opposition from enemies, Jehovah has seen to it that
his Word is the most widely translated book in the history of mankind.
Even at a time when many have little
or no faith in God, the Bible remains
a best seller and is now available, in
whole or in part, in over 2,800 languages. Though some Bible translations are not as clear or as reliable
as others, it is still possible to learn
the Bible’s basic message of hope
and salvation from nearly all translations. w15 12/15 1:13, 14

Monday, January 23
Thoughtless speech is like the stabs
of a sword.—Prov. 12:18.
Words have the power to hurt as
well as to heal. Using words to in?ict pain is common in Satan’s
world. The ?eld of entertainment incites many to “sharpen their tongue
just like a sword” and to “aim their
cruel words like arrows.” (Ps.
64:3) A Christian needs to avoid this
harmful practice. One example of
“cruel words” is sarcasm, stinging
remarks intended to belittle or re-

buke others. Sarcasm is often
meant to be humorous, but it can
quickly deteriorate into disrespectful, insulting speech. Cruel sarcasm
is one form of abusive speech that
Christians should “put away.” Humor can add spice to our speech,
but we need to avoid the trap of
trying to evoke a laugh by resorting
to cutting, sarcastic quips that hurt
or humiliate others. The Bible admonishes us: “Let a rotten word not
come out of your mouth, but only
what is good for building up as the
need may be, to impart what is bene?cial to the hearers.”—Eph. 4:29,
31. w15 12/15 3:10

If you carefully keep yourselves
from these things, you will prosper. Good health to you!
—Acts 15:29.
These ?nal words of the letter
that the ?rst-century governing
body sent to the congregations can
also be rendered “be strong.” We
de?nitely want to prosper in “good
health” and be strong as we serve
our great God. As long as the present system of things remains and
we are imperfect, sickness is a fact
that we must face. We cannot expect
now to be cured miraculously. However, Revelation 22:1, 2 points to the
time when we will be healed completely. The apostle John saw in vision “a river of water of life” and
“trees of life” with leaves “for the
healing of the nations.” This does
not refer to any herbal remedy now
or in the future. Rather, it points to
Jehovah’s provision through Jesus
for giving everlasting life to obedient mankind—truly something we
can look forward to.—Isa. 35:5, 6.
w15 12/15 4:17, 18

Wednesday, January 25
We want to go with you, for we
have heard that God is with you
people.—Zech. 8:23.
Speaking of the time in which we
are living, Jehovah foretold: “In
those days ten men out of all the
languages of the nations will take
hold, yes, they will take ?rm
hold of the robe of a Jew, saying:
‘We want to go with you, for we have
heard that God is with you people.’ ”
(Zech. 8:23) Like the ?gurative
ten men, those who have an earthly hope have taken “?rm hold of the
robe of a Jew.” They are proud to associate with the spirit-anointed “Israel of God,” knowing that Jehovah
is blessing his anointed ones. (Gal.
6:16) As did the prophet Zechariah,
Jesus highlighted the refreshing
unity that is experienced by God’s
people. He spoke of his followers
as two groups, a “little ?ock” and
“other sheep,” but he said that
they would be “one ?ock” with “one
shepherd.”—Luke 12:32; John 10:16.
w16.01 4:1, 2

Thursday, January 26
Continue considering these things.
—Phil. 4:8.
We need to safeguard our spirituality. Because we live in a world
that is dominated by Satan the Devil and because we are imperfect,
it is easy for us to adopt the wrong
thinking and conduct of the world.
The world’s spirit might be compared to a river current that is pulling us in a direction we do not want
to go. To avoid being swept downstream, we must vigorously swim in
the other direction. Similarly, effort is required to keep from being

swept away by the spirit of Satan’s
world. When we are preaching to
others, we focus on important and
bene?cial spiritual matters, not on
thoughts that will erode our faith.
Preaching strengthens our convictions, reminding us of God’s promises and loving standards. It also
helps keep our spiritual armor intact. (Eph. 6:14-17) If we keep busy
in our spiritual activities, we simply
do not have time to become overly
concerned with our own problems,
and that helps to protect us. w16.01

Friday, January 27
Your people will be my people, and
your God my God.—Ruth 1:16.
Note Ruth’s love for Jehovah. The
landowner Boaz later praised Ruth
for seeking refuge under Jehovah’s
wings. (Ruth 2:12) That may remind
us of a baby bird taking refuge under the wings of a powerful, protective parent. (Ps. 36:7; 91:1-4) Jehovah became such a parent to
Ruth. He rewarded her for her faith,
and she never had any reason to regret her decision. Today, many learn
about Jehovah but hesitate to take
refuge in him. They hold back from
becoming his dedicated, baptized
servants. If you hesitate to make
a dedication to Jehovah, have you
stopped to ask yourself why? Everyone alive serves some god or other.
(Josh. 24:15) Why not take refuge in
the only God worth serving? Making a dedication to Jehovah is an excellent way to demonstrate faith in
him. He will help you live up to that
decision and face whatever challenges may arise. That is what God
did for Ruth. w16.02 2:6, 7

Saturday, January 28
Let me pin him to the ground with
the spear just once, and I will not
need to do it twice.—1 Sam. 26:8.
When Abishai crept into Saul’s
camp, he did not have his loyalties
in the proper order. Out of loyalty
to David, Abishai was eager to kill
King Saul, but David restrained him,
realizing that it would be wrong to
lift one’s hand “against the anointed
of Jehovah.” (1 Sam. 26:9-11) From
that incident, we learn an important
lesson: Although we can properly
have several loyalties in our heart,
the correct order of their importance should be determined by our
application of Bible principles. Loyalty springs from the heart, but the
human heart is treacherous. (Jer.
17:9) Thus, one who is loyal to God
could easily feel strong ties of loyalty to a close friend or relative even
if that person is practicing what is
bad. Especially when someone close
to us abandons the truth must we remember that Jehovah always merits our primary loyalty.—Matt. 22:37.
w16.02 4:5, 6

Sunday, January 29
Prove to yourselves the good and
acceptable and perfect will of God.
—Rom. 12:2.
Why did Christians in Rome need
to prove to themselves something
that they had already accepted?
Consider a Bible example. Timothy
knew the Scriptures well. He had
been taught “from infancy” by his
mother and grandmother. Nevertheless, Paul urged Timothy: “Continue in the things that you
learned and were persuaded to believe.” (2 Tim. 3:14, 15) According
to one reference work, the original-

language word for “persuaded” has
the sense “to be convinced and certain of the truth of something.” Timothy had made the truth his own. He
accepted it, not because his mother and grandmother told him to do
so, but because he had reasoned on
it for himself and had been persuaded. (Rom. 12:1) Likewise, diligent
personal study can help you answer
questions, resolve any doubts, and
strengthen your convictions.—Acts
17:11. w16.03 2:3, 4, 7

Monday, January 30
[They went] from year to year to
Jerusalem for the festival of the
Passover.—Luke 2:41.
Picture the Israelites in Bible
times praising Jehovah during a
festival at his temple in Jerusalem. They would have prepared for
the journey, cared for one another’s needs en route, and then been
united in worship at the temple.
All of this called for cooperation. As we continue our journey toward the new world, we too need
to be harmoniously joined together and cooperating. Think of what
blessings await us! We have already
left behind the disunity and confusion marking the present system of
things. We now see being ful?lled
what both Isaiah and Micah foretold
—God’s people are unitedly going
up to “the mountain of Jehovah.”
(Isa. 2:2-4; Mic. 4:2-4) Indeed, how
elevated our form of worship is in
“the ?nal part of the days.” But how
great will be our happiness and joy
when we live at the time when all
mankind will be harmoniously
joined together and cooperating!

Some elders may ?nd it hard to
set aside time for training others. Perhaps they think: ‘Training
is important, but it is not as urgent
as other congregation matters that
simply cannot wait. If I have to postpone training for a while, the congregation will continue to function.’
Though it is true that numerous
matters require an elder’s immediate attention, delaying training may
harm the spiritual well-being of the

congregation. Elders care for many
important tasks that have to be handled promptly. But if elders keep
postponing necessary training,
sooner or later the congregation
will lack su?cient quali?ed brothers to care for all that needs to be
done. Clearly, then, we should guard
against thinking that training is of
low priority. Elders who take a longrange view and invest their time in
training less experienced brothers
are wise stewards and a true blessing to the entire congregation.

Draw close to God, and he will
draw close to you.—Jas. 4:8.

Endure under tribulation. Persevere in prayer.—Rom. 12:12.

Are you a dedicated, baptized
Witness of Jehovah? If so, you have
a precious possession—a personal relationship with God. However,
that relationship is under attack
by pressures not only from Satan’s
world but also from our own imperfect ?esh. This trying situation
faces all Christians. Therefore, our
relationship with Jehovah must be
as strong as possible. How real to
you is your personal relationship with Jehovah? Would you like
to strengthen it? James 4:8, our text
for today, tells you how you can do
that. Note that this is a two-way process. As we take steps to draw close
to God, he takes reciprocating action toward us. This interaction,
frequently repeated, progressively
strengthens our relationship with
Jehovah. As a result, that relationship becomes very real to us. We develop the kind of con?dence Jesus
had when he said: “The One who
sent me is real, and . . . I know him.”
—John 7:28, 29. w15 4/15 3:1, 2

Suppose a beloved relative is disfellowshipped. From your study of
the Bible, you know how disfellowshipped ones are to be treated.
(1 Cor. 5:11; 2 John 10) Yet, upholding the disfellowshipping decision
may at times seem very di?cult,
even impossible. Can you trust that
your heavenly Father will give you
the fortitude you need to be resolute in abiding by the Bible’s direction about disfellowshipping? Do
you see here an opportunity for you
to make your relationship with Jehovah stronger by forming a closer
bond with him? Does this suggest
that we should not have strong love
for our relatives? Of course not! But
our strongest love should be for Jehovah. (Matt. 22:37, 38) This is actually in the best interests of our relatives, whether they are presently
serving Jehovah or not. And if you
are particularly troubled over the
course of a disfellowshipped relative, pour out your heart to Jehovah
in prayer.—Phil. 4:6, 7. w15 4/15 4:

There is an appointed time for

We ourselves take pride in you
among the congregations of God
because of your endurance and
faith.—2 Thess. 1:4.
Feeling good about the works of
others and even having a degree of
pride in ourselves can be healthy.
We are not expected to be ashamed
of our family, culture, or the region where we grew up. (Acts 21:39)
On the other hand, there is a kind
of pride that can eat away at relationships and damage our friendship with Jehovah. Such pride can
cause us to resent and reject needed
counsel rather than humbly accept
it. (Ps. 141:5) This type of pride is de?ned as “inordinate self-esteem” or
“a haughty attitude shown by people
who believe, often unjusti?ably, that
they are better than others.” Jehovah hates arrogant pride. (Ezek. 33:
28; Amos 6:8) But Satan must delight to see humans display boastful
pride, for it echoes his own arrogance. How Satan must have reveled
in the boasting of such men as Nimrod, Pharaoh, and Absalom—all of
whom fell victim to improper pride!

You open your hand and satisfy
the desire of every living thing.
—Ps. 145:16.
Re?ecting his Father, ‘Christ, the
power of God,’ frequently opened
his hand and satis?ed the desires of
his followers. (1 Cor. 1:24) His doing so was not merely an expression of power. He was guided by his
heartfelt concern for others. Consider Matthew 14:14-21. Jesus’ disciples
came to him to discuss the food situation. Not only may they themselves
have been hungry but they were con-

cerned about the plight of the famished and weary crowd that had followed Jesus on foot from the cities.
(Matt. 14:13) What would he do? With
?ve loaves and two ?sh, Jesus fed
about 5,000 men, as well as women
and children! The crowds “ate and
were satis?ed.” This suggests that
there was an abundant supply of
food. Jesus kindly provided, not a
mere taste of bread, but a meal that
would sustain the crowds for their
long journey back home. (Luke 9:1017) And 12 baskets were ?lled with
the leftovers! w15 6/15 1:8, 9

Sunday, February 5
The sons of men promote
depravity.—Ps. 12:8.
With immorality so pervasive, you
may wonder, ‘Is it really possible
to live a chaste life?’ Yes, with Jehovah’s help. However, in order to
live a chaste life, we must reject immoral desires. Just as a baited
hook may attract a ?sh, so immoral thoughts and lewd desires—when
not immediately dismissed—may begin to draw out and entice a Christian. They can appeal to our fallen
?esh and lead us toward immoral
acts. In time, the allure of sin may
become so great that the unclean desire becomes fertile. At that
point, even a servant of Jehovah
may be ready to act on his desire
when an opportunity arises. Yes,
“desire . . . gives birth to sin.” (Jas.
1:14, 15) It is sobering to re?ect on
how a momentary desire can develop into a serious sin. But how encouraging it is to know that if we
prevent unclean desires from taking root, we need not become involved in immoral conduct and suffer its bitter consequences!—Gal. 5:
16. w15 6/15 3:1-3

Monday, February 6
Let your will take place . . . on
earth.—Matt. 6:10.
About 6,000 years ago, God’s will
was being done perfectly on earth.
That is why Jehovah could look
upon the ?ne start he had given to
mankind and say: “It was very good.”
(Gen. 1:31) Then Satan rebelled, and
ever since, comparatively few humans have done God’s will on earth.
But today we are privileged to be
alive at a time when about eight million Witnesses not only are praying for God’s will to take place on
earth but also are striving to live in
harmony with that prayer. They do
so by their way of life and by having a zealous share in the disciplemaking work. Until the enemies of
God’s Kingdom are removed from
the earth, we will continue to pray
for God’s will to be done. Then we
will see God’s will taking place in an
even more complete way as billions
are resurrected on a paradise earth.
(John 5:28, 29) What a wonderful
time to be alive to welcome back our
dead loved ones! w15 6/15 4:15, 17

Tuesday, February 7
I will glorify the place for my feet.
—Isa. 60:13.
The expression “spiritual paradise” has become a part of our theocratic vocabulary. It describes
our unique, spiritually rich environment, or condition, which allows us
to enjoy peace with God and with
our brothers. Of course, we should
not conclude that the terms “spiritual paradise” and “spiritual temple”
are the same. The spiritual temple
is God’s arrangement for true worship. The spiritual paradise serves

to identify clearly those who have
God’s approval and who are today serving him at his spiritual temple. (Mal. 3:18) How exciting it is to
know that since 1919, Jehovah has
allowed imperfect humans to work
with him in cultivating, strengthening, and expanding the spiritual
paradise on earth! Do you see yourself playing a part in this marvelous
work? Are you moved to continue
working with Jehovah in glorifying
‘the place for his feet’? w15 7/15 1:

I [will] sanctify myself through you
before their eyes, O Gog.
—Ezek. 38:16.
Shortly before the remaining
ones of the 144,000 are taken to
heaven, Gog will attack God’s
people. What reaction does this provoke? On earth, God’s people will
appear to be defenseless. They will
obey the instructions given in the
days of King Jehoshaphat: “You will
not need to ?ght this battle. Take
your position, stand still, and see
the salvation of Jehovah in your behalf. O Judah and Jerusalem, do not
be afraid or be terri?ed.” (2 Chron.
20:17) In heaven, however, there is a
di?erent reaction. Referring to the
time when all the anointed are in
heaven, Revelation 17:14 tells us this
about the enemies of God’s people:
“These will battle with the Lamb,
but because he is Lord of lords and
King of kings, the Lamb will conquer them. Also, those with him who
are called and chosen and faithful will
do so.” Together with his 144,000 corulers in heaven, Jesus will come to
the rescue of God’s people here on
earth. w15 7/15 2:16

Thursday, February 9
There is an appointed time for
everything.—Eccl. 3:1.
Our respect for the God who invites us to Christian meetings
should be manifested in our decorum, dress, and grooming. Respect also requires that we avoid
extremes. Jehovah wants his servants and other guests to feel comfortable at the Kingdom Hall. At
the same time, those in attendance
would not want to detract from the
meetings by being overly casual in
their dress, by texting or talking
during the meetings, by eating and
drinking, and so on. Parents should
train their children to understand
that the Kingdom Hall is not the
place for running or playing. Filled
with indignation, Jesus threw out of
God’s temple those who were introducing commercial activities. (John
2:13-17) Our Kingdom Halls too are
places for pure worship and spiritual education. So any business activities that have nothing to do with
spiritual pursuits ought to be taken
care of elsewhere.—Compare Nehemiah 13:7, 8. w15 7/15 4:7, 8

Friday, February 10
In the last days critical times hard
to deal with will be here.
—2 Tim. 3:1.
The Bible indicates that wickedness will greatly increase “in the
last days.” (2 Tim. 3:13; Matt. 24:21;
Rev. 12:12) So we can expect that
world conditions, bad as they are
now, will continue to decline.
But how bad do you expect conditions to become before “the great
tribulation”? (Rev. 7:14) For example, do you expect that there will

be a war in every country, no
food on anyone’s table, and illness
in every household? Under those
conditions, even skeptics would
likely feel compelled to admit that
Bible prophecy was undergoing ful?llment. However, Jesus said that
most people would take “no note”
of his presence, carrying on with
life’s normal activities until it is too
late. (Matt. 24:37-39) Thus, the
Scriptures indicate that world conditions during the last days would
not become so extreme that people would be forced to believe that
the end is near.—Luke 17:20; 2 Pet. 3:
3, 4. w15 8/15 2:6, 7

Saturday, February 11
Your loyal love is better than life.
—Ps. 63:3.
Does spending our time preparing
for God’s new world mean forfeiting a better or more ful?lling way of
life today? By no means! Serving Jehovah is the most satisfying way of
life there is. It is not a matter of servitude under duress just so that we
can pass through the great tribulation. It is the way we are designed to
live, the way that yields the greatest
joy. Having Jehovah’s guidance and
experiencing his loyal love are far
better than life apart from intimacy with him. (Ps. 63:1, 2) Of course,
we need not wait for the new world
in order to enjoy spiritual blessings
that result from wholehearted service to Jehovah—they are available
to us right now! Indeed, some of us
have been reaping such blessings
for decades, and we know from experience that no other life course
could produce greater satisfaction.

You have been saved through
faith.—Eph. 2:8.
Faith enables us to do things that
from a human standpoint may seem
impossible. (Matt. 21:21, 22) For instance, many of us have changed
our attitudes and practices so drastically that we are almost unrecognizable to those who knew us before. Jehovah supported our e?orts
because we took these steps
based on our faith in him. (Col. 3:510) Once our faith moved us to dedicate ourselves to Jehovah, we became his friends, something we
could never have done in our own
power. Our faith continues to empower us. In faith we are able to resist the attacks of our superhuman
adversary, the Devil. (Eph. 6:16) In
addition, trust in Jehovah helps us
to minimize our anxiety during
challenging times. Jehovah says
that when our faith moves us to put
Kingdom interests ?rst, he will provide for our material needs. (Matt.
6:30-34) More than that, because of
our faith, we will receive a gift no
human could ever obtain by his own

We love, because [God] ?rst loved
us.—1 John 4:19.
In what way has God “?rst loved
us”? The apostle Paul said: “God
recommends his own love to us
in that, while we were yet sinners,
Christ died for us.” (Rom. 5:8) Love
is Jehovah’s dominant attribute, so
we can understand why Jesus told
one inquirer that the ?rst commandment from God is: “You must
love Jehovah your God with your
whole heart and with your whole

soul and with your whole mind and
with your whole strength.” (Mark
12:30) From Jesus’ words, we learn
that love for God involves, ?rst of
all, our heart. Being halfhearted is
displeasing to Jehovah. However,
we note that love for God also involves our whole soul, mind, and
strength. This means that genuine
love for God is much more than just
an emotional feeling of the heart. In
addition to being heartfelt, our love
for God must involve all our spiritual and physical faculties. According
to the prophet Micah, that is what
Jehovah wants from us.—Mic. 6:8.

My ears have heard about you, but
now I do see you with my eyes.
—Job 42:5.
What are some reasons why we
may not clearly see God’s hand in
our a?airs? Life’s challenges can
overwhelm us. When this happens, we may forget to keep focused
on how Jehovah has already helped
us. When Queen Jezebel threatened
the prophet Elijah’s life, even Elijah
momentarily forgot how God had
acted in his behalf. Regarding Elijah, the Bible says: “He asked that
he might die.” (1 Ki. 19:1-4) What was
the solution to Elijah’s problem? He
needed to look to Jehovah for encouragement. (1 Ki. 19:14 -18) Job
also got so distracted by his own
concerns that he neglected to see
things from God’s viewpoint. (Job
42:3-6) Like Job, we may need to put
forth greater e?ort to see God. How
can we do that? In the light of the
Scriptures, we need to meditate on
what is happening around us. As we
become aware of how Jehovah supports us, he will become more real
to us. w15 10/15 1:15, 16

Man, who appointed me judge or
arbitrator between you two?
—Luke 12:14.
Many things happened during Jesus’ ministry that could have distracted him, but he never succumbed to them. Early in his
ministry, after he had taught the
crowds and performed miracles in
Capernaum, people begged him not
to leave their city. But how did Jesus react to this ?attering request? He said: “I must also declare
the good news of the Kingdom of
God to other cities, because for this
I was sent.” (Luke 4:42-44) True to
his word, Jesus walked the length
and breadth of Palestine, preaching
and teaching. Though perfect, he
had normal human needs and sometimes felt very tired because of expending himself in God’s service.
(Luke 8:23; John 4:6) On a later occasion while Jesus was teaching his
followers how to cope with opposition, a man interrupted, saying:
“Teacher, tell my brother to divide
the inheritance with me.” But Jesus refused to be drawn into this
dispute.—Luke 12:13-15. w15 10/15 3:

God is love.
—1 John 4:8.
Love is God’s dominant quality,
his most important one. Jehovah
does not just possess love—he is the
personi?cation of it. How wonderful it is to know that the Creator of
the universe and of all living things
is a God of love! Everything he does
is guided by that quality. The warm,
benevolent a?ection that God has
for his creatures assures us that all

his purposes for the human family will be ful?lled in the best possible way and will result in the greatest bene?t to all who come under
his rulership. For example, out of
love Jehovah “has set a day on
which he purposes to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by
a man whom he has appointed,” Jesus Christ. (Acts 17:31) We can be
con?dent that this will come to
pass. For rightly disposed and obedient humans, favorable judgment
will result in a truly blessed future
that will go on and on throughout all
eternity. w15 11/15 3:1, 2

Let your words always be
gracious, seasoned with
salt.—Col. 4:6.
In our preaching work, we meet
with varied responses—some favorable, some hostile. Regardless of
how people react, however, God’s
Word shows the standard that
his servants must maintain. When
we make a defense before everyone
who demands of us a reason for our
hope, we do so “with a mild temper
and deep respect” because we are
motivated by neighbor love. (1 Pet.
3:15) We show love of neighbor even
if our message is rejected by an angry householder who berates us. We
imitate Jesus: “When he was being
insulted, he did not insult in return.
When he was su?ering, he did not
threaten, but he entrusted himself
to the One [Jehovah] who judges
righteously.” (1 Pet. 2:23) Whether
we are with fellow believers or others, we show humility and apply the
counsel: “Do not pay back injury for
injury or insult for insult. Instead,
repay with a blessing.”—1 Pet. 3:8, 9.

Advise [them] . . . to love their
children.—Titus 2:4.
Jesus did not hesitate to tell his
disciples that he loved them.
(John 15:9) He also showed his
love by closely and regularly associating with his disciples. (Mark 6:
31, 32; John 2:2; 21:12, 13) Similarly, tell your children that you love
them, and regularly show them how
much they mean to you. (Prov. 4:3)
Samuel, who lives in Australia, says:
“When I was very young, Dad used
to read My Book of Bible Stories to
me every evening. He would answer
my questions, hug me, and kiss me
good-night. What a surprise when
I later discovered that Dad was not
raised in a family where hugs and
kisses were common! Yet, he made
a real e?ort to express his love for
me. As a result, I developed a strong
bond with him, and I felt contented
and secure.” Help your children to
feel that way by often telling them
“I love you.” Show your a?ection for
your children. Talk with them, eat
with them, play with them. w15 11/15

Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics, to give
them their food at the proper time?
—Matt. 24:45.
When early in the last century a
small group of diligent Bible students was appointed as “the faithful
and discreet slave,” much of their
communication with the “domestics” was in English. That “slave” has
put forth great e?ort to make spiri-

tual food available in more and more
languages; the number has now risen to over 700. There was also a need
for a Bible that would accurately
convey in modern speech the intent
of the original writings. The New
World Bible Translation Committee
was formed, and over a ten-year period from 1950 to 1960, the committee’s translation was released in six
volumes. When releasing the ?rst
volume on August 2, 1950, Brother N. H. Knorr expressed the hope
that this translation would spread its
spiritual help to millions of people.

The congregator sought to ?nd delightful words and to record accurate words of truth.—Eccl. 12:10.
Do you ?nd that it is often a challenge to come up with “delightful
words”? If so, you may need to enlarge your vocabulary. One way to
do this is to take note of how
words are used in the Bible and in
our Christian publications. Learn
the meanings of unfamiliar expressions. More important, learn how to
use words in a way that helps others. Regarding the relationship between Jehovah and his ?rstborn
Son, we read: “Jehovah has given me [Jesus] the tongue of those
taught, so that I may know how to
answer the tired one with the
right word.” (Isa. 50:4) Taking time
to meditate on what we are going
to say can help us to ?nd the right
words. (Jas. 1:19) We could ask ourselves, ‘Will these words really convey what I want to say? What e?ect
will my choice of words have on my
listener?’ w15 12/15 3:12

Tuesday, February 21
The desolating of [Jerusalem] has
drawn near.—Luke 21:20.
Seeing Jerusalem “surrounded
by encamped armies,” just as Jesus
had prophesied, Christians in Judea, and especially those living in
Jerusalem, had to act decisively.
Jesus had warned them that they
would need to ?ee as soon as they
saw these events start to unfold.
(Luke 21:21-24) In the 28 years since
Jesus had uttered that prophecy,
the faithful Jewish Christians living
in Israel had already faced much opposition and persecution successfully. (Heb. 10:32-34) Yet, Paul knew
that they were about to be confronted with one of the most challenging tests of their faith. (Matt. 24:
20, 21; Heb. 12:4) He wanted them
to be prepared for whatever might
come their way. They would need
exceptional endurance and faith
—faith strong enough to preserve
their lives. (Heb. 10:36-39) So Paul
was prompted by Jehovah’s spirit to write those dear brothers and
sisters a letter designed to meet
their special needs. That letter is
now known as the book of Hebrews.

Beloved ones, if this is how God
loved us, then we are also under obligation to love one another.
—1 John 4:11.
We cannot properly accept God’s
love without recognizing our obligation to love our brothers. (1 John
3:16) How can we demonstrate our
love in practical ways? Consider the
example of Jesus. During his earthly ministry, he gave special attention to lowly ones. He reached out
to those with physical in?rmities

—the lame, the blind, the deaf, and
the speechless. (Matt. 11:4, 5) Jesus took pleasure in teaching spiritually hungry ones, those who were
viewed by the Jewish religious leaders as “accursed people.” (John 7:
49) He loved these lowly ones and
worked hard to minister to them.
(Matt. 20:28) Can you consider the
brothers and sisters in your own
congregation? No doubt you will
see some who could bene?t from
your love. Perhaps there are elderly ones who need help. We must let
God’s love move us to reach out and
express our love for our brothers.

I have other sheep, which are not
of this fold; those too I must bring
in, . . . and they will become one
?ock, one shepherd.—John 10:16.
Do those of the other sheep need
to know the names of all those who
are anointed today? The short answer is no. Why not? Because even
if someone has received the heavenly calling, that person has received only an invitation, not a ?nal
con?rmation of the reward. That is
why Satan raises up “false prophets
. . . to mislead, if possible, even the
chosen ones.” (Matt. 24:24) No
one can know whether an anointed
Christian will receive his heavenly reward until Jehovah judges that
person to be worthy of such a prize.
Jehovah makes this determination
and gives him the ?nal sealing either sometime before he dies faithful or sometime before the outbreak
of “the great tribulation.” (Rev. 2:10;
7:3, 14) It would be pointless, then,
for anyone now living on earth to
try to ascertain who among God’s
servants will eventually be part of
the 144,000. w16.01 4:2, 3

Friday, February 24
[My word] will have sure success in
what I send it to do.—Isa. 55:11.
Think about how the preaching of
the good news ?ts in with Jehovah’s
loving purpose for humankind. He
purposed that humans would inhabit the earth without ever dying;
though Adam sinned, Jehovah did
not change His mind. Instead, he
arranged for humans to be delivered from condemnation to sin and
death. Working along with that purpose, Jesus came to earth and sacri?ced his life for obedient humans. In
order to become obedient, however,
they had to understand what God required of them. So Jesus also taught
people what God’s requirements
are, and he commanded his disciples to do the same. By helping others to become reconciled to God, we
share directly in his loving arrangement to rescue mankind from sin
and death. This also demonstrates
our love both for our fellow man and
for Jehovah, “whose will is that all
sorts of people should be saved and
come to an accurate knowledge of
truth.”—1 Tim. 2:4. w16.01 5:15, 16

[Ahaz] burned up his sons in the
?re.—2 Chron. 28:3.
Ahaz’s son Hezekiah might easily
have grown up to be a bitter, angry
man who turned against God. Others who have endured far less have
become “enraged against Jehovah”
or embittered toward his organization. (Prov. 19:3) And some people
are convinced that their unwholesome family background dooms
them to lead a bad life, perhaps to
repeat their parents’ mistakes.
(Ezek. 18:2, 3) Are such notions correct? Hezekiah’s life record gives

us a resounding answer: Absolutely not! There is never a valid reason to become embittered against
Jehovah, for he is not the source of
the evils that befall people in this
wicked world. (Job 34:10) True, parents can exert a strong in?uence
on their children for good or for
bad. (Prov. 22:6; Col. 3:21) But this
does not mean that a person’s family background determines his
course in life. On the contrary, Jehovah has given all of us a precious
gift—the ability to choose what we
will do and who we will be.—Deut.

Ruthless men seek my life.
—Ps. 54:3.
Abner supported Saul’s e?orts to
kill David, even though Abner knew
that God had chosen David to rule as
king of Israel. (1 Sam. 26:1-5) After Saul’s death, Abner could have
shown humility and proved his loyalty to God by supporting David, not
Saul’s son Ish-bosheth. Later, when
Abner had relations with King Saul’s
concubine, he may have been seeking the throne for himself. (2 Sam. 2:
8-10; 3:6-11) Similarly, lack of humility prevented David’s son Absalom
from being loyal to God. Why, “Absalom acquired for himself a chariot and horses and 50 men to run
before him”! (2 Sam. 15:1) He also
stole the people’s loyalty. Like Abner, Absalom sought to kill David,
even though he knew that Jehovah
had appointed David as Israel’s king.
(2 Sam. 15:13, 14; 17:1-4) The examples of Abner and Absalom make it
clear that inordinate ambition can
easily cause a person to become disloyal to God. Surely, no faithful servant of Jehovah would pursue such
a sel?sh and wicked course. w16.02 4:

Faith by itself, without works, is
dead.—Jas. 2:17.

This is the way. Walk in it.
—Isa. 30:21.

If you have strong conviction, it is
reasonable to expect that you
will show it by your actions. Young
ones must also manifest “holy acts
of conduct.” (2 Pet. 3:11) To do so,
you must be morally clean. How are
you doing in that regard? For example, think about the past six
months. How have you demonstrated that your “powers of discernment” have been trained to distinguish right from wrong? (Heb. 5:
14) Can you think of speci?c occasions when you resisted temptation
or peer pressure? Does your conduct at school speak well of your
faith? Do you stand up for your faith
rather than try to blend in with your
classmates just to avoid ridicule?
(1 Pet. 4:3, 4) Admittedly, no one is
perfect. Even longtime servants of
Jehovah may at times feel timid
about taking a public stand for
their faith. However, a person who
is dedicated to Jehovah will rightly be proud to bear God’s name, and
he shows this by his conduct. w16.03
2:10, 11

Down through history, Jehovah
has provided speci?c instructions
or directions. For example, in the
garden of Eden, Jehovah gave clear
instructions that could guide the
human family to everlasting life and
happiness. (Gen. 2:15-17) Had Adam
and Eve obeyed his direction, they
would have been spared tragic consequences—a life ?lled with pain
and ending in their death with no
hope. But rather than obey, Eve listened to advice that seemed to
come from a lowly animal. Adam,
in turn, listened to her voice, the
voice of a mortal human. Both of
them turned their backs on their
loving Father’s guidance. Consequently, the human family in general was on a fatal path. Today, Jehovah stands before his people, as
it were, pointing them toward
everlasting life, away from dangers.
More than that, he acts like a loving shepherd to his ?ock, calling out
to the sheep proper direction
and warnings so that they can avoid
dangerous paths. w16.03 4:2, 3

and united, not only now but especially when turbulent times come
during the great tribulation. (Ezek.
38:10-12; Mic. 5:5, 6) Therefore, dear
elders, we appeal to you to make
training a regular feature of your
ministry today. Of course, we understand that the time you spend on
caring for important congregation
activities may already make you feel
stretched to the limit. Hence, you
may need to take some of that
time and use it for training. (Eccl.

You do not know what your life will
be like tomorrow.—Jas. 4:14.
Forward-looking elders share in a
timely fashion with younger brothers the experience they have acquired during their years of faithful service. (Ps. 71:17, 18) Elders who
train others are a blessing to the
?ock. They strengthen the congregation’s defenses. How? The e?orts
of elders to train others result in
more brothers who will be ready to
help the congregation to stand ?rm

Your own ears will hear a word behind you saying, “This is the way.
Walk in it.”—Isa. 30:21.
You no doubt agree that the Bible
contains God’s message for mankind in general. But does the Bible
also convey how you in particular
can draw closer to Jehovah? Indeed it does. How? As you regularly read and study the Bible, consider your response to what it says and
give thought to how you can apply
it to your circumstances; then
you are allowing Jehovah to talk to
you through his Word. This draws
you into a closer relationship with
him. (Heb. 4:12; Jas. 1:23-25) For example, read and meditate on Jesus’
words to “stop storing up for yourselves treasures on the earth.” If
you feel that you are already focusing your life on Kingdom interests,
you sense Jehovah’s commendation. On the other hand, if you see a
need to simplify your life and to focus more on Kingdom interests, Jehovah has alerted you to an area
where you can work at drawing closer to him.—Matt. 6:19, 20. w15 4/15

The Lord stood near me and infused power into me, so that
through me the preaching might
be fully accomplished and all the
nations might hear it; and I was
rescued from the lion’s mouth.
—2 Tim. 4:17.
As we, like Paul, busy ourselves in
the preaching work, we trust that
Jehovah will see to it that all other
necessary things “will be added” to
us. (Matt. 6:33) As Kingdom preachers, we have been “entrusted with
the good news,” and we are con-

sidered by Jehovah to be his “fellow workers.” (1 Thess. 2:4; 1 Cor.
3:9) By being as active as possible
in God’s work, we will ?nd it easier to wait for relief. Let us, then,
use the present time to strengthen
our relationship with God. If
any situation makes us anxious, use
it to draw closer to Jehovah. Yes, by
being immersed in God’s Word, by
praying continually, and by staying
absorbed in spiritual activities, let
us trust that Jehovah can and will
see us through our present circumstances as well as everything else
that lies ahead. w15 4/15 4:17, 18

Saturday, March 4
What is the source of the wars and
?ghts among you?—Jas. 4:1.
Pride can disrupt the peace of a
congregation. Deep-seated feelings
of animosity and superiority can affect our speech and actions, causing untold pain to others. (Prov. 12:
18) If we personally have a tendency
to feel superior to others, we need
to remember that “everyone proud
in heart is detestable to Jehovah.”
(Prov. 16:5) We would also do well to
examine our view of those who belong to another race, nationality, or
culture. If we harbor feelings of racial or national pride, we ignore the
fact that God “made out of one man
every nation of men.” (Acts 17:26)
In that sense, there is just one race
because all mankind has a common
ancestor, Adam. Therefore, how absurd it is to believe that some races
are inherently superior or inferior. Such thinking would suit Satan’s
scheme to disrupt our Christian
love and unity. (John 13:35) To ?ght
Satan and win, we must resist all
forms of improper pride.—Prov. 16:

Become imitators of God.
—Eph. 5:1.
Undoubtedly, we rejoice that God
has promised immortality in heaven
to faithful anointed ones and everlasting life on earth to Jesus’ loyal
“other sheep.” (John 10:16; 17:3;
1 Cor. 15:53) Of course, neither immortal life in heaven nor eternal life
on earth will be plagued by the suffering common today. Jehovah is
aware of the pain we experience,
even as he knew how the Israelites
su?ered as slaves in Egypt. Indeed,
“during all their distress it was distressing to him.” (Isa. 63:9) Centuries later, the Jews were afraid because of enemy opposition to the
rebuilding of the temple, but God
said: “Whoever touches you touches the pupil of my eye.” (Zech. 2:8)
Just as a mother has tender feelings for her baby, Jehovah is moved
to act lovingly in behalf of his people. (Isa. 49:15) In a sense, Jehovah
can put himself in the place of others, and he has given us that ability.
—Ps. 103:13, 14. w15 5/15 4:2

You always have the poor with
you.—Matt. 26:11.
Did Jesus mean that there would
always be poor people on the earth?
No, he meant that there would be
poor people as long as this corrupt
system of things lasts. Today
the basic needs of hundreds of millions of people go unmet because
of unjust human rule. Yet, relief
is in sight! (Ps. 72:16) Jesus’ miracles give us con?dence in his ability and his desire soon to use his au-

thority for our good. (Matt. 14:14 21) Though we cannot perform miracles, we can enthusiastically draw
people’s attention to God’s inspired
Word. Bible prophecies guarantee
better times ahead. As dedicated
Witnesses of Jehovah who possess
this precious knowledge about the
future, do we not sense that we have
a debt toward others? (Rom. 1:14, 15)
May meditating on this move us to
tell others the good news of God’s
Kingdom.—Ps. 45:1; 49:3. w15 6/15 1:

Cleanse your hands, . . . and
purify your hearts.—Jas. 4:8.
When we treasure our friendship
with Jehovah, we strive to please
him in every aspect of our life, including our thoughts. We desire to
have “a pure heart” by focusing our
minds on what is chaste, virtuous,
and praiseworthy. (Ps. 24:3, 4; 51:6;
Phil. 4:8) Granted, Jehovah makes
allowances for our imperfect nature. He knows that we are prone to
improper desires. But we recognize
that it saddens him when we nurture wrong thoughts instead of doing all we can to reject them. (Gen.
6:5, 6) Re?ecting on this fact makes
us ever more determined to keep
our thoughts chaste. An important
way to show our complete reliance
on Jehovah is by making our ?ght
against unclean thoughts a matter
of prayer. When we draw close to Jehovah in prayer, he draws close to
us. He generously gives us his holy
spirit, thus strengthening our resolve to resist immoral thoughts
and remain chaste. w15 6/15 3:4, 5

Give us today our bread for this
day.—Matt. 6:11.
Notice that this is a personal request not purely for “my” bread for
the day but for “our” bread for
the day. Victor, a circuit overseer in Africa, explains: “I often sincerely thank Jehovah that my wife
and I don’t have to be seriously concerned about where our next meal
will come from, nor do we have to
worry about who will pay the rent.
Our brothers kindly look after us
every day. But I do pray that those
helping us will manage to handle
the economic pressures they face.”
If we have su?cient food for many
days, we can think of brothers who
live in poverty or who are a?ected by disasters. We should not only
pray for them but also act in harmony with our prayers. For example, we can share what we have with
fellow worshippers in need. We
can also regularly contribute to the
worldwide work, knowing that such
funds are used wisely.—1 John 3:17.

God is our God forever and ever.
He will guide us forevermore.
—Ps. 48:14.
A marvelous work of transformation in connection with the earthly
part of Jehovah’s organization was
foretold at Isaiah 60:17. Those who
are young or comparatively new in
the truth have read about the evidences of this transformation or
have heard about it from others. But
how privileged the brothers and sisters are who have personally experienced it! No wonder they are con-

vinced that by means of his
enthroned King, Jehovah is guiding and directing His organization!
They know that their con?dence is
well-founded, a con?dence all of us
share. Hearing their heartfelt expressions will fortify your faith and
strengthen your trust in Jehovah.
Regardless of how long we have
been in the truth, we must tell others about Jehovah’s organization.
The existence of a spiritual paradise in the midst of a wicked, corrupt, and loveless world is a
modern-day miracle! w15 7/15 1:12, 13

They gathered them together to
the place that is called in Hebrew
Armageddon.—Rev. 16:16.
The war of Armageddon will lead
to the magnifying of Jehovah’s
holy name. At that time, all goatlike ones “will depart into everlasting cutting-o?.” (Matt. 25:31-33, 46)
The earth will ?nally be cleansed of
all wickedness, and the great
crowd will pass through the ?nal
part of the great tribulation.
With these exciting events ahead
of us, what should each of us now
be doing? The apostle Peter was inspired to write: “Since all these
things are to be dissolved in this
way, consider what sort of people
you ought to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion,
as you await and keep close in mind
the presence of the day of Jehovah
. . . Therefore, beloved ones, since
you are awaiting these things, do
your utmost to be found ?nally by
him spotless and unblemished and
in peace.” (2 Pet. 3:11, 12, 14) Let us,
then, be resolved to remain spiritually clean, supporting the King of
Peace. w15 7/15 2:17, 18

Unless Jehovah builds the house,
it is in vain that its builders work
hard on it.—Ps. 127:1.
Jehovah’s organization goes to
tremendous lengths to provide and
help ?nance modest Kingdom
Halls. The work of designing, building, and remodeling them is handled by unpaid volunteers. Since
November 1, 1999, more than 28,000
beautiful new centers of pure worship have been provided for congregations worldwide. That means that
for 15 years, on average, ?ve
new Kingdom Halls have been provided every day of the year. E?orts
are being made to support the construction of Kingdom Halls wherever they are needed. This loving
provision is based on the Scriptural principle that the surplus of
some might o?set the de?ciency of
others, in order that “there may be
an equalizing.” (2 Cor. 8:13-15) As
a result, beautiful new centers of
pure worship have been provided
for congregations that would otherwise never have had the ?nancial

Keep in expectation of it!
—Hab. 2:3.
For the composite sign of Christ’s
presence to serve its purpose, the
ful?llment of it would have to be obvious enough to command the attention of those who have been
obeying Jesus’ counsel to “keep
on the watch.” (Matt. 24:27, 42) And
that has been the case since
1914. From that time onward, the
features of the sign have been undergoing ful?llment. Clearly, we are

now living in “the conclusion of the
system of things”—a limited period of time leading up to and including the destruction of this wicked system. (Matt. 24:3) Why, then,
should Christians today keep in expectation? Out of obedience to Jesus Christ, we remain in expectation. Also, we recognize the sign of
his presence. Our expectations are
based, not on a naive readiness to
believe anything, but on solid Scriptural evidence that compels us to remain vigilant, awake, watchful and,
yes, in expectation of this wicked
system’s end. w15 8/15 2:8, 9

You . . . satisfy the desire of every
living thing.—Ps. 145:16.
Personal interests and pleasures
will have their place in God’s
new world. After all, why did Jehovah create us with a hunger for personal accomplishment and wholesome pleasures if he did not intend
to have us satisfy these desires to
the full? (Eccl. 2:24) In this and other ways, Jehovah will always “satisfy the desire of every living thing.”
Recreation and relaxation have
their place, but the pleasure derived
from them is increased when we put
our relationship with Jehovah ?rst.
It will also be that way in the earthly Paradise. How wise it is for us
to learn to keep personal interests
in their proper place while we seek
?rst the Kingdom and focus on the
spiritual blessings now available
to Jehovah’s people! (Matt. 6:33) In
the coming Paradise, we will attain
happiness on a level that we have
never before experienced. May we
show the intensity of our desire for
the real life by preparing for it now.

Put on the new personality that
was created according to God’s
will in true righteousness
and loyalty.—Eph. 4:24.
During his life on earth as a perfect man, Jesus was surrounded by
imperfect humans. He was raised
by imperfect parents, and he spent
years at home with imperfect relatives. Even his closest followers
were in?uenced by the ambitious, manipulative spirit common around them. For example, on
the evening before Jesus was executed, there “arose a heated dispute
among them over which one of them
was considered to be the greatest.”
(Luke 22:24) But Jesus was con?dent that his imperfect followers
could grow spiritually and form a
united congregation. That same
evening, Jesus prayed for the loving unity of his apostles, asking his
heavenly Father: “May [they] all be
one, just as you, Father, are in union
with me and I am in union with you,
that they also may be in union with
us, . . . in order that they may be one
just as we are one.”—John 17:21, 22.

He said: “Come!” So Peter got out
of the boat and walked over
the waters and went toward Jesus.
—Matt. 14:29.
The wind and waves surrounding
Peter as he walked on the water
might be compared to the trials and
temptations we face in our life of
dedication to God. Even when these
are severe, we can stand ?rm with
Jehovah’s support. Recall that Peter did not sink because of a gust of

wind or a big wave. Think back on
the sequence of events: “Looking at
the windstorm, he became afraid.”
(Matt. 14:24 -32) Peter lost his focus on Jesus, and then his faith wavered. We could begin to sink if we
were to begin “looking at the windstorm,” focusing on its power and
doubting that Jehovah will support
us. We should take seriously the
possibility that our faith could diminish, for the Bible refers to a
weakening of faith or loss of faith
as “the sin that easily entangles us.”
(Heb. 12:1) As Peter’s experience
shows, our faith can quickly weaken if we focus on the wrong things.

Thursday, March 16
Every good gift and every perfect
present is from above, coming
down from the Father of the celestial lights.—Jas. 1:17.
When you receive a gift, what do
you do? Most likely you show your
appreciation in some way. In addition, you will likely make good use
of the gift, not taking it for granted. Jehovah unfailingly provides
what we need to live and to be happy. Does that not move us to want
to love him in return? The Israelites lived under Jehovah’s loving
care for hundreds of years and were
bountifully blessed by him, in both
material and spiritual ways. (Deut.
4:7, 8) Their continuing to receive
such blessings, however, was contingent on their obeying God’s Law,
which included regularly o?ering to
Jehovah “the best of the ?rst ripe
fruits” of the land. (Ex. 23:19) The
Israelites would thus demonstrate
that they did not take for granted
Jehovah’s love and blessings.
—Deut. 8:7-11. w15 9/15 5:5, 6

Happy are the pure in heart, since
they will see God.—Matt. 5:8.
How might we see Jehovah’s hand
in our lives? Consider: Perhaps you
feel that the way you received the
truth was clearly at God’s direction.
Have you ever attended Christian
meetings, heard a part, and said:
“That was just what I needed”? Or
you may have experienced an
answer to a prayer. Maybe you decided to expand your ministry and
were amazed at how Jehovah
helped to work things out for you.
Or have you ever experienced leaving a job for spiritual reasons and
then seen the truth of God’s
promise: “I will never abandon
you”? (Heb. 13:5) By being spiritually alert and “pure in heart,” we can
discern how Jehovah has helped us
in many ways. How can we be “pure
in heart”? We must be clean on the
inside and stop any wrong conduct.
(2 Cor. 4:2) As we cultivate stronger
spirituality and manifest upright
conduct, we put ourselves among
those who can see God. w15 10/15 1:

If anyone would minister to me,
the Father will honor him.
—John 12:26.
Among the crowds in Jerusalem
were some Greek proselytes who
evidently were so impressed with
Jesus that they asked the apostle Philip to arrange a meeting with
him. Jesus, however, refused to be
distracted from the more important
matters that lay ahead. He certainly did not want to try to gain
popularity in order to avoid a sacri?cial death at the hands of God’s

enemies. So after explaining that he
would soon die, he said to Andrew
and Philip: “Whoever is fond of his
life destroys it, but whoever hates
his life in this world will safeguard
it for everlasting life.” Rather than
satisfy the curiosity of those
Greeks, he recommended following
his self-sacri?cing course and said
the words of today’s text. No doubt,
Philip carried this positive message
back to the inquirers. (John 12:2025) Though Jesus refused to be distracted from his main purpose of
preaching the good news, he was
not always thinking about work.

Sunday, March 19
All those for whom I have a?ection, I reprove and discipline.
—Rev. 3:19.
Although Jesus’ disciples repeatedly argued about who was the
greatest among them, Jesus did not
give up on them. He also did not ignore it when they failed to respond
to his counsel. Lovingly and mildly,
Jesus reproved them at a suitable
time and place. (Mark 9:33-37) Show
your love for your children by disciplining them. It is sometimes
enough to explain why a certain
course is right or wrong. At other
times, a child may fail to apply what
you say. (Prov. 22:15) When that
happens, imitate Jesus. At a ?tting
time and place, discipline your child
lovingly and mildly through patient
guidance, training, and correction.
“My parents never disciplined me in
anger or without explaining why I
was being disciplined,” says Elaine,
a sister in South Africa. “As a result, I felt secure. I knew my boundaries, and I understood what was
required of me.” w15 11/15 1:5, 6

God is love.
—1 John 4:16.
Imagine what life would be like if
God did not have love for mankind.
We merely have to look at the awful history of this world with its human rulerships under its unloving
and wrathful god, Satan the Devil.
(2 Cor. 4:4; 1 John 5:19; Rev. 12:9, 12)
This shows us how horrible the future would be if the universe were
to function without the operation of
God’s love. When rebelling against
Jehovah’s rule, the Devil challenged
the rightfulness and righteousness
of God’s universal sovereignty. In
e?ect, Satan claimed that his rule
would be better than that of the Creator. (Gen. 3:1-5) Though Jehovah
permitted Satan to try to prove his
side of the issue, such permission
was temporary. In his great wisdom,
Jehovah has allowed enough time
to pass to expose very clearly the
inadequacy of any rule other than
his. The miserable record of mankind shows that neither humans nor
Satan can provide what we need in
the way of good rulership. w15 11/15

Tuesday, March 21
Make a defense . . . with a mild
temper and deep respect.
—1 Pet. 3:15.
By maintaining a humble attitude, Jehovah’s people obey an important principle given by Jesus.
In his Sermon on the Mount, he declared: “You heard that it was said:
‘You must love your neighbor and
hate your enemy.’ However, I say to
you: Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those who persecute you, so that you may prove

yourselves sons of your Father who
is in the heavens, since he makes
his sun rise on both the wicked and
the good and makes it rain on both
the righteous and the unrighteous.”
(Matt. 5:43-45) Yes, as God’s servants, we must learn to ‘love our enemies,’ regardless of their attitude
toward us. In all areas of life, Jehovah’s people must show by their
attitude and actions that they love
Jehovah and their neighbor. For instance, even if some do not respond
favorably to the Kingdom message,
we show neighbor love when they
are in need. w15 11/15 4:17, 19, 20

Wednesday, March 22
They understood the words that
had been made known to them.
—Neh. 8:12.
God’s people have always used
their ability to speak—to use
language—to praise Jehovah and to
make his will known to others. In
recent times, a signi?cant way to
promote pure worship by the use
of language has been through Bible
translation. There are thousands of
Bible translations, but they vary in
how faithfully they convey the message from the original texts. In the
1940’s, the New World Bible Translation Committee established principles of translation that have been
followed in over 130 languages.
These are: (1) Sanctify God’s name
by restoring it to its rightful place
in the Scriptures. (Matt. 6:9)
(2) Translate the original inspired
message literally where possible,
but convey the correct sense when a
word-for-word rendering would distort the meaning. (3) Use easy-tounderstand language that encourages reading.—Neh. 8:8. w15 12/15

Thursday, March 23
If the trumpet sounds an indistinct
call, who will get ready for battle?
—1 Cor. 14:8.
An indistinct trumpet call could
be disastrous for an advancing
army. In the same way, if our speech
is unduly vague or indirect, it may
well be confusing or misleading.
(1 Cor. 14:9) Of course, in our e?ort
to keep our words crisp and clear,
we would not want to be blunt or
tactless. Jesus set the ?nest example of appropriate word selection.
Consider his short yet powerful discourse recorded in Matthew chapters 5 through 7. Jesus did not use
?owery or ambiguous speech; nor
did he employ harsh or hurtful language. Instead, he chose clear, simple expressions to reach the hearts
of his listeners. For example, to allay the people’s anxieties over their
daily need for food, he referred to
how Jehovah provides for the birds
of heaven. Then, comparing his
hearers to birds, he asked: “Are you
not worth more than they are?”
(Matt. 6:26) What a loving appeal in
simple, understandable words that
touch the heart! w15 12/15 3:13, 14

Friday, March 24
Let your brotherly love continue.
—Heb. 13:1.
What does it mean for us to show
brotherly love? The Greek term
used by Paul, phi·la·del·phi1a, literally means “a?ection for a brother.”
Brotherly love is the type of a?ection that involves a strong, warm,
personal attachment, such as to a
family member or a close friend.
(John 11:36) We do not pretend
to be brothers and sisters—we are

brothers and sisters. (Matt. 23:8)
Our strong feeling of attachment to
one another is summed up nicely in
these words: “In brotherly love have
tender a?ection for one another. In
showing honor to one another, take
the lead.” (Rom. 12:10) Combined
with principled love, a·ga1pe, this
type of love promotes close companionship among God’s people. Christianity embraces all believers, no
matter what their nationality. (Rom.
10:12) As brothers, we have been
taught by Jehovah to have brotherly
a?ection for one another.—1 Thess.
4:9. w16.01 1:5, 6

Saturday, March 25
The love the Christ has compels
us.—2 Cor. 5:14.
Our love for Jesus moves us to
work whole-souled in the preaching
and disciple-making work. (Matt.
28:19, 20; Luke 4:43) During the Memorial season, we will have the opportunity to serve as an auxiliary
pioneer and spend 30 or 50 hours
in the preaching work. Could
you arrange your circumstances to
do so? One 84-year-old widower did
not feel that he could auxiliary pioneer because of his age and poor
health. Nonetheless, the pioneers in
his area rallied to his aid. They provided transportation and carefully
chose territory that he could work,
so that he could meet his 30-hour
goal. Could you reach out and help
someone share in the joy of auxiliary pioneering during the Memorial
season? Of course, not all of us may
be able to auxiliary pioneer. Even
so, we can use whatever time and
energy we have to increase our sacri?ce of praise to Jehovah. w16.01 2:

Sunday, March 26
We want to go with you, for we
have heard that God is with you
people.—Zech. 8:23.
If it is not possible to know with
certainty the names of all spiritual Israelites on earth today, how
can members of the other sheep “go
with” them? Notice what the prophecy in Zechariah states concerning
the ?gurative ten men. These ones
would “take ?rm hold of the robe of
a Jew, saying: ‘We want to go with
you, for we have heard that God is
with you people.’” Although only one
Jew is mentioned here, in both instances the pronoun “you” refers to
more than one person. This spiritual Jew must, then, be a composite
person, not just one individual! So
it is not necessary to identify every
spiritual Jew and then go with him
or her. Rather, we need to identify
these ones as a group and then support them as such. In no way do the
Scriptures encourage us to follow
an individual. Jesus is our Leader.

You, O Israel, are my servant, you,
O Jacob, whom I have chosen, the
o?spring of Abraham my friend.
—Isa. 41:8.
From the cradle to the grave, our
greatest need is love. Humans do
need and crave love—and not just
the romantic kind. We hunger
for friendship and connection with
others. But there is one kind of love
that we need more than any other
—Jehovah’s love. Many ?nd it hard
to imagine that humans could acquire a close, loving friendship with
Almighty God. Do we share such

skepticism? Far from it! The Bible
shows that imperfect humans have
become friends with God. Their examples are worth contemplating,
for building such a friendship is the
most worthwhile goal we could pursue in life. An outstanding example of a man who cultivated such a
friendship was Abraham. (Jas. 2:23)
How did Abraham draw so close to
Jehovah? A key ingredient in that
friendship was faith. In fact, the Bible calls Abraham “the father of all
those having faith.”—Rom. 4:11.

There was no one like him.
—2 Ki. 18:5.
Although Hezekiah was the son
of one of Judah’s worst kings, he
grew up to be one of the very
best. (2 Ki. 18:6) Hezekiah set about
righting the terrible wrongs that
his father had committed. He did
so by cleansing the temple, atoning
for the people’s sins, and destroying pagan idols in a vigorous and
far-reaching campaign. (2 Chron.
29:1-11, 18-24; 31:1) When he faced
daunting challenges, such as the
threat of attack on Jerusalem by the
Assyrian king Sennacherib, Hezekiah showed profound courage and
faith. He relied on God for salvation and strengthened his people by
word and example. (2 Chron. 32:7, 8)
Later, when Hezekiah needed correction for showing a haughty attitude, he humbled himself and repented. (2 Chron. 32:24-26) Clearly,
Hezekiah did not let his past ruin
his present or deprive him of a future. Rather, he showed that he was
Jehovah’s friend and a ?ne example
to imitate. w16.02 2:11

If a man takes a false step before
he is aware of it, you who have
spiritual quali?cations try to readjust such a man in a spirit of
mildness.—Gal. 6:1.
Kindness can help you to deal
with a con?ict of loyalties. For example, you may have de?nite knowledge that a certain fellow believer
is guilty of serious misconduct. You
may feel loyal to him, especially if
he is a close friend or a relative. But
if you were to cover up the
wrongdoing, you would be disloyal
to God. Of course, your loyalty to
Jehovah should come ?rst. Be kind
yet ?rm. Urge your friend or relative to seek the help of the elders.
If he or she does not do so within a
reasonable period of time, loyalty to
God should move you to report the
matter to the elders. In doing this,
you are being loyal to Jehovah and
kind to your friend or relative, for
Christian elders will try to readjust
such an individual with mildness.
—Lev. 5:1. w16.02 4:14

Consider what sort of people you
ought to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion.
—2 Pet. 3:11.
“Deeds of godly devotion” include
your activities in the congregation,
such as your meeting attendance
and participation in the ministry.
Also included are spiritual activities that others do not see, such as
your private prayers and your personal study. A person who has dedicated his life to Jehovah will not
consider these deeds to be chores.

Rather, he will re?ect the attitude of
King David, who said: “To do your
will, O my God, is my delight, and
your law is deep within me.” (Ps.
40:8) Remember, as a dedicated and
baptized Christian, you will stand
before Jehovah on your own. Your
service to him should not depend on
others—not even your parents. Your
holy acts of conduct and deeds of
godly devotion give evidence that
you have made the truth your own
and that you are progressing toward baptism. w16.03 2:10, 12, 15

Friday, March 31
Before the faith arrived, we were
being guarded under law. . . . So
the Law became our guardian
leading to Christ.—Gal. 3:23, 24.
The Mosaic Law acted as a protective wall against the degraded moral and religious acts of other nations. When Israel listened to
God, the nation received his blessing. When they ignored him, they
su?ered dire consequences. (Deut.
28:1, 2, 15) Directions were needed
for another reason. The Law pointed to an important development as
to Jehovah’s will. That was the coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.
The Law made it clear as never before that the Israelites were imperfect. It also impressed on them the
need for a ransom, a perfect sacri?ce that would fully cover sin. (Gal.
3:19; Heb. 10:1-10) Furthermore, the
Law helped to preserve the genealogical line leading to the Messiah
and to identify him when he appeared. Yes, the Law acted as a temporary tutor, or “guardian,” leading
to Christ. w16.03 4:6, 7

Saturday, April 1
Be watchful! Your adversary, the
Devil, walks about like a roaring
lion, seeking to devour someone.
—1 Pet. 5:8.
At one time, he enjoyed a ?ne
standing with Jehovah. At some
point, however, this spirit creature
began to desire the worship of humans. Rather than dismiss that improper desire, he nurtured it and
let it grow until it gave birth to sin.
(Jas. 1:14, 15) We know that creature
as Satan, who “did not stand fast in
the truth.” He rebelled against Jehovah and became “the father of the
lie.” (John 8:44) Since his rebellion,
Satan has proved to be Jehovah’s
greatest enemy, and he certainly
has not been a friend of mankind.
The titles given to Satan reveal the
depth of his corruption. Satan
means “Resister,” indicating that
this wicked spirit creature does not
support God’s sovereignty; rather,
he hates it and aggressively ?ghts
it. More than anything else, Satan
wants to see the end of Jehovah’s
sovereignty. w15 5/15 1:1, 2

Sunday, April 2
If anyone loves God, this one is
known by him.—1 Cor. 8:3.
Studying the Scriptures does
more than reveal areas in which we
can improve spiritually. It also
deepens our appreciation for Jehovah’s endearing ways, causing
us to love him even more. And when
our love for God grows, his love for
us intensi?es, thus strengthening
our bond with him. For us to draw
close to Jehovah, however, it is essential that we study with the right

objective. John 17:3 says: “This
means everlasting life, their coming to know you, the only true God,
and the one whom you sent, Jesus
Christ.” Thus, our objective should
be not merely to take in knowledge
but to come to “know” Jehovah better as a Person. (Ex. 33:13; Ps. 25:4)
As we come to know Jehovah more
intimately, we will not be unduly disturbed if certain Bible accounts
leave us wondering why he acted as
he did. w15 4/15 3:6-8

Monday, April 3
[Timothy] will remind you of my
methods in connection with Christ
Jesus, just as I am teaching everywhere in every congregation.
—1 Cor. 4:17.
Recently, a group of elders who
are successful in helping brothers
to grow spiritually were asked what
approach they use when training
others. Though the circumstances
of these brothers vary greatly, the
advice they gave was strikingly similar. What does this indicate? That
Bible-based training is applicable to learners “everywhere in every
congregation”—just as it was in the
apostle Paul’s day. A teacher needs
to create the right conditions for
training. Just as a gardener needs
to cultivate, or loosen, the soil before sowing seeds, so a teacher
needs to prepare, or encourage, the
heart of a learner before teaching
him new skills. So how do teachers
create the right conditions for
training others? By following an approach similar to that taken by
Samuel when he was preparing Saul
to lead Israel.—1 Sam. 9:15-27; 10:1.

The whole world is lying in the
power of the wicked one.
—1 John 5:19.
Much of what this world promotes
runs counter to the standards set
forth in the Bible. Of course, not
everything the world o?ers is evil.
However, we should expect that Satan would use his world to exploit our desires and try to induce
us to sin or to develop love for the
world and neglect our worship of
Jehovah. (1 John 2:15, 16) Evidently, love for the world a?ected some
?rst-century Christians. For example, Paul wrote: “Demas has forsaken me because he loved the present system of things.” (2 Tim.
4:10) The Bible does not speci?cally say what aspect of the world Demas loved, causing him to abandon
Paul. It could be that Demas began
to love material things more than
spiritual pursuits. If that was the
case, Demas missed out on thrilling
spiritual privileges—and for what?
Could the world possibly o?er Demas anything that would surpass
the blessings Jehovah could give
him as an associate of Paul?
—Prov. 10:22. w15 5/15 2:10, 11

Wednesday, April 5
Jehovah is merciful and compassionate.—Ps. 103:8.
Jesus sensed the pain of others,
even those whose exact circumstances he had never experienced.
For instance, the common people
lived in fear of the religious leaders,
who deceived them and burdened
them with many man-made rules.
(Matt. 23:4; Mark 7:1-5; John 7:13)
Jesus was never frightened or deceived, but he could understand situations that he had not lived

through. Therefore, “on seeing the
crowds, he felt pity for them, because they were skinned and
thrown about like sheep without a
shepherd.” (Matt. 9:36) Like his Father, Jesus was loving and compassionate. When Jesus saw people su?ering, he was moved to show
them love. Thus, he perfectly re?ected the love of his Father. After
one extensive preaching tour, Jesus
and his apostles were about to go to
an isolated place to get some rest.
Because he felt pity for the crowd
awaiting him, however, Jesus took
time “to teach them many things.”
—Mark 6:30, 31, 34. w15 5/15 4:3, 4

Thursday, April 6
I was especially fond of the sons of
men.—Prov. 8:31.
God’s ?rstborn Son was the earliest and most complete expression
of Jehovah’s unfathomable wisdom.
He was wisdom personi?ed, “a master worker” alongside his Father. We
can only imagine the joy and satisfaction that he experienced as his
Father “prepared the heavens” and
“established the foundations of the
earth.” However, though appreciating these inanimate things, God’s
?rstborn Son “was especially fond
of the sons of men.” (Prov. 8:22-31)
Yes, Jesus has a fondness, or tender
a?ection, for mankind that stretches back to his prehuman existence.
Later, as proof of his loyalty and
love for his Father, as well as of his
deep love for “the sons of men,”
God’s Firstborn willingly “emptied
himself” and came to be in the likeness of men. He did so in order
to provide “a ransom in exchange
for many.” (Phil. 2:5-8; Matt. 20:28)
What love he has for the human family! w15 6/15 2:1, 2

God sent his only-begotten Son
into the world so that we might
gain life through him.—1 John 4:9.
Do you appreciate what Jehovah
has done for you? Then it would be
?tting to dedicate your life to Jehovah and get baptized. Remember,
dedication involves a solemn promise to Jehovah to do his will forever,
no matter what happens. Should
you be afraid to make such a commitment? Not at all! Bear in mind
that Jehovah has your best interests at heart, and he is “the rewarder of those earnestly seeking
him.” (Heb. 11:6) Dedicating yourself to Jehovah and getting baptized do not make your life worse.
On the contrary, serving Jehovah
will make your life better. How different Jehovah is from Satan,
whose interest in you is only sel?sh!
Satan o?ers no lasting reward to
those who side with him. And really, how can he give you something
that he does not possess? w16.03 2:

Saturday, April 8
Father, I thank you that you have
heard me. True, I knew that you
always hear me.—John 11:41, 42.
For your relationship with Jehovah to be real, you must be convinced that he is hearing prayers.
Consider this: From his prehuman
existence, Jesus observed ?rsthand
Jehovah’s response to the prayers
of His human servants. Then, during his earthly ministry, Jesus used
prayer as his means of communicating his feelings to his Father in

heaven. Would he have done so
—even spending an entire night in
prayer—had he thought that Jehovah was not really listening?
(Luke 6:12; 22:40-46) Would he have
taught his disciples to pray had
he thought that prayer was nothing
more than a psychological crutch?
Clearly, Jesus knew that prayer is

Abba, Father, all things are possible for you; remove this cup from
me. Yet, not what I want, but what
you want.—Mark 14:36.
When you pray humbly in the
presence of your children, they will
learn to rely on Jehovah. Ana, who
lives in Brazil, states: “When there
were problems, such as when my
grandparents were ill, my parents
would ask Jehovah to give them the
strength to cope with the situation
and the wisdom to make good decisions. Even when under terrible
pressure, they left their problems in Jehovah’s hands. As a result, I learned to rely on Jehovah.”
When you pray with your children,
do not pray just for them. Ask Jehovah to help you too—perhaps to help
you speak to your employer about
getting time o? for a convention,
to give you courage to witness to
your neighbor, or to help you in other ways. Humbly rely on God, and
your children will learn to do so too.

You must love Jehovah your God
with your whole heart and with
your whole soul and with your
whole mind.—Matt. 22:37.
One of the best ways that you can
grow in your love for Jehovah is to
meditate on the greatest gift Jehovah has provided—the ransom
sacri?ce of his Son. (2 Cor. 5:14, 15;
1 John 4:9, 19) Thinking about the
ransom and what it means for you
will motivate you to respond appreciatively. Your response to the ransom might be illustrated this way:
Imagine that someone rescued you
from drowning. Would you simply
go home, dry yourself o?, and forget about what was done for you? Of
course not! You would certainly feel
indebted to the person who rescued
you. The fact is, you would owe that
person your life! We owe Jehovah
God and Jesus Christ much more.
Because of this great act of love, we
now have the incomparable prospect of living forever on a paradise
earth! w16.03 2:16, 17

Christ died for us.—Rom. 5:8.
Jehovah had complete con?dence
in his only-begotten Son, who had
been faithful to him in heaven for
countless ages. On earth, Jesus
maintained his integrity and upheld
Jehovah’s sovereignty under the severest of tests, dying as a faithful
servant of his Father. How grateful
we should be that by his death, Jesus also paid the ransom price needed to redeem mankind and open
the way to everlasting life in God’s

promised new world! The apostle
John wrote: “By this the love of God
was revealed in our case, that God
sent his only-begotten Son into the
world so that we might gain life
through him. The love is in this respect, not that we have loved God,
but that he loved us and sent his Son
as a propitiatory sacri?ce for our
sins.”—1 John 4:9, 10. w15 11/15 3:

Death spread to all men because
they had all sinned.—Rom. 5:12.
As children of the ?rst man,
Adam, we have all inherited sin and
its penalty, death. Not one of us can
say, “I do not need the ransom.”
Even the most faithful servant of
God is completely dependent on Jehovah’s undeserved kindness
through Christ. Each of us must
recognize that we have been forgiven an enormous debt. What should
Jehovah’s love and mercy compel us
to do? If we are harboring some resentment against any of our brothers or sisters, we should imitate Jehovah, who is “ready to forgive.”
(Neh. 9:17; Ps. 86:5) If we appreciate what Jehovah has done for us in
canceling our own enormous debt,
then we will want to forgive others
from our heart. We simply cannot
receive the love and forgiveness of
God unless we love and forgive others. (Matt. 6:14, 15) While it is true
that forgiving will not change the
past, it will certainly change our future for the good. w16.01 2:5, 15-17

You who have followed me will sit
on 12 thrones, judging the 12 tribes

Jesus said the above words to
help Peter and other disciples to
imagine the future. They could thus
contemplate their role in the government that would rule over the
earth and bring grand blessings to
obedient mankind. Jehovah’s earthly servants have always bene?ted from thinking about the ful?llment of divine promises. Abel
knew enough about God’s purposes to envision a better future, exercise faith, and embrace a reliable
hope. Abraham’s outstanding acts
of faith were possible because he
“saw” something about the ful?llment of God’s prophecy concerning the promised “o?spring.” (Gen.
3:15) Moses “looked intently toward
the payment of the reward,” acting
in faith and growing in love for Jehovah. (Heb. 11:26) Our own faith
in God and love for him can help us
to envision what Jehovah has promised. w15 5/15 3:17, 18

Christ . . . [left] a model for you to
follow his steps closely.
—1 Pet. 2:21.
In line with the model Jesus provided, a Christian who wants to
grow spiritually will not be satis?ed
with a super?cial knowledge of the
Bible. He will regularly dig deeply
into its contents, realizing that “solid food belongs to mature people.”
(Heb. 5:14) Clearly, a mature Christian wants to have “accurate knowl-

edge of the Son of God.” (Eph. 4:13)
Do you schedule daily Bible reading? Do you follow a routine of personal study, making every e?ort to
set aside time each week for family worship? As you consider God’s
Word, be alert to Scriptural principles that will help you to see
more clearly how Jehovah thinks
and feels. Then try to apply Bible
principles, relying on them when
you make decisions, thus drawing
ever closer to Jehovah. w15 9/15 1:5,

Christ is the power of God.
—1 Cor. 1:24.
Jesus fully understands earth’s
ecology. He knows how to use, manage, and distribute earth’s resources fairly and properly. When
on earth, Jesus showed that he is
“the power of God” by exercising control over the forces of nature. Picture the scene: Christ is
exhausted from his demanding ministry. The waves are pounding the
ship, hurling spray and foam
into the boat. Yet, despite the noise
of the storm and the violent
pitching of the boat, Jesus continues to sleep. His body needs rest.
The frightened disciples wake Jesus up and exclaim: “We are about
to perish!” (Matt. 8:25) Rousing himself, Jesus commands the wind and
the sea with the words: “Hush! Be
quiet!” and the raging wind stops.
(Mark 4:39) Jesus is, in e?ect, commanding the wind and the sea to be
quiet and to stay that way. The result? “A great calm set in.” What
power Jesus displays! w15 6/15 1:

Sunday, April 16
Give us today our bread for this
day.—Matt. 6:11.
In referring to our daily bread,
Jesus likely meant our immediate needs. Thus, he went on to
show how God clothes the wild?owers, and then he said: “Will he not
much rather clothe you, you with little faith?” He concluded by repeating this important advice: “Never be
anxious about the next day.” (Matt.
6:30-34) This shows that rather
than be materialistic, we should be
content with our basic daily needs.
Such needs may include suitable
accommodations, employment to
provide for our family, and wisdom
to cope with health concerns. If we
were to pray only for such physical needs, however, it would indicate an imbalance. We have spiritual needs that are of much greater
importance. “Man must live,” said
our Master, “not on bread alone, but
on every word that comes from Jehovah’s mouth.” (Matt. 4:4) So we
should continue to pray that Jehovah will keep on feeding us with
timely spiritual food. w15 6/15 5:

Monday, April 17
Do not bring us into temptation.
—Matt. 6:13.
Do we regularly petition God to
help us maintain our integrity when
we are faced with temptation? Our
upbringing or our past conduct may
have developed in us a liking for
practices that Jehovah condemns.
Even then, he can help us to bring
about necessary changes so that we
can continue to serve him acceptably. King David recognized this.
After he had committed adultery

with Bath-sheba, David implored
Jehovah: “Create in me a pure
heart, . . . and put within me a new
spirit, a steadfast one.” (Ps. 51:10,
12) Sinful conduct may strongly appeal to our fallen ?esh, but Jehovah can stir within us a willing spirit, the desire to obey him. Even if
wrong desires are deeply rooted
and tend to crowd out our chaste
thoughts, Jehovah can guide our
steps so that we can obey his commandments and succeed in living
by them. He can prevent anything
harmful from dominating us.—Ps.
119:133. w15 6/15 3:5, 6

Through many advisers there is
victory.—Prov. 24:6.
Older ones in our midst remember when congregations had a
congregation servant rather than a
body of elders, when countries
had a branch servant rather than
a Branch Committee, and when direction was given by the president
of the Watch Tower Society rather
than by a clearly established
Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Although all these devoted
brothers were supported by faithful
assistants, one person was basically responsible for making decisions
in the congregations, at the branch
o?ces, and at world headquarters.
During the 1970’s, adjustments were
made to put the responsibility for
oversight on groups of elders rather than on individuals. These adjustments were based on increased
knowledge about the pattern set in
the Scriptures. Instead of having
the in?uence of one individual dominate, the composite good qualities
of all the “gifts in men” whom Jehovah has provided bene?t the organization.—Eph. 4:8. w15 7/15 1:14, 15

Wednesday, April 19
They are no part of the world.
—John 17:16.
Loyalty and neutrality are always
issues for true Christians, not just
in times of war. Why? Because all
who are dedicated to Jehovah have
promised him their love, loyalty,
and obedience. (1 John 5:3) We want
to abide by God’s righteous standards wherever we live and whatever our background, nationality,
or culture. Loyalty to Jehovah and
to his Kingdom transcends any other attachment we may have. (Matt.
6:33) Such loyalty requires that
Christians remain separate from all
con?icts and controversies of this
world. (Isa. 2:4; John 17:11, 15, 16)
People who do not share our faith
may feel a special loyalty to their
country, tribe, or culture or even
to their national sports team. Challenges to such loyalties have resulted in competition and rivalry and,
in extreme cases, bloodshed and
genocide. It would be all too easy
to take sides in worldly issues and
be drawn into controversy. w15 7/15

Let all things take place decently
and by arrangement.—1 Cor. 14:40.
Once a new Kingdom Hall is built,
it needs to be kept clean and tidy to
re?ect the qualities and personality of the God whom we worship—a
God of order. (1 Cor. 14:33) The Bible associates holiness and spiritual cleanness with physical cleanliness. (Rev. 19:8) Thus, if people
desire to be acceptable to Jehovah,
they must also practice good hygiene. In harmony with these principles, we should always feel comfort-

able inviting interested people to
our meetings, con?dent that the
condition of the hall will complement the good news we share with
them. They will see that we worship
a God who is holy and who will soon
transform the earth into an uncontaminated paradise. (Isa. 6:1-3;
Rev. 11:18) Whatever the local situation, our Kingdom Hall should be
exemplary when it comes to being
well-kept, since it bears the name of
Jehovah and is a place of pure worship.—Deut. 23:14. w15 7/15 4:13-15

Friday, April 21
Keep on the watch.
—Mark 13:35.
Upon recognizing that Christ’s
presence began in 1914, Jesus’ followers rightly prepared for a possible early arrival of the end. They did
so by intensifying their Kingdompreaching work. Jesus indicated
that he might come later—“at dawn
or early in the morning.” If that happened, how were his followers to respond? He said: “Keep on the
watch.” So a long wait would not
justify mentally postponing the end
or totally dismissing their expectations. In the new world, we will
have reason to re?ect on the fact
that all the foretold events associated with the conclusion of the system of things did indeed take place.
Meditating on how matters actually
turned out will further strengthen
our con?dence in Jehovah and his
promises yet to be ful?lled. (Josh.
23:14) We will surely be thankful
that God, who ‘has placed times and
seasons in his own jurisdiction,’ exhorted us to live with an awareness
that ‘the end of all things had drawn
close.’—Acts 1:7; 1 Pet. 4:7. w15 8/15 2:

All those desiring to live with
godly devotion in association
with Christ Jesus will also be
persecuted.—2 Tim. 3:12.
For entertainment, many people
view or practice things that the Bible identi?es as violent, sexually immoral, spiritistic, or ungodly in other ways. For instance, the Internet,
television programs, movies, novels,
and magazine articles often present
violence and immorality in a favorable light. Behavior once considered
unacceptable has even been legalized in some places. But that does
not make such conduct acceptable
to God. (Rom. 1:28-32) In the ?rst
century, Jesus’ followers shunned
unclean entertainment. Because of
this and their godly conduct in general, they were maligned and persecuted by others. “They are puzzled that you [Christians] do not
continue running with them in the
same decadent course of debauchery,” wrote the apostle Peter, “so
they speak abusively of you.”—1 Pet.

When each respective member
functions properly, this contributes to the growth of the body as it
builds itself up in love.—Eph. 4:16.
A mature servant of Jehovah promotes unity within the congregation. (Eph. 4:1- 6, 15) It is our
goal that God’s people be “harmoniously joined together” and that
all members cooperate with one another. According to Jehovah’s
Word, to achieve this unity, we
need humility. A mature brother or
sister has the humility to work for
unity, even when facing the imper-

fections of others. How do you react
when confronted with the imperfection of a brother or sister in the
congregation? Or what if you personally are wronged by someone in
the congregation? Is it your inclination, or even your pattern, to build
a wall, so to speak, that separates
you from the o?ender? Or do you
try to construct a bridge across the
gap between the two of you? A mature Christian wants to—yes, strives
to—build bridges, not walls. Do you
have the goal of promoting unity in
the congregation? w15 9/15 1:12, 13

Monday, April 24
Your word is truth.
—John 17:17.
Jesus was convinced that the Bible is God’s Word, which provides
the best guidance in life. Following
Jesus’ example, we must read the
Bible daily, study it, and meditate
on what we learn. Along with general Bible study, dig into topics about
which you may have questions. To
illustrate, you might increase your
conviction that the end of this system of things really is near by studying in detail the Scriptural proof
that we live in the last days.
Strengthen your trust in the Bible’s
promises for the future by investigating its many prophecies that
have already come true. Develop
your con?dence in the practical value of the Bible by considering examples of how the Bible improves people’s lives. (1 Thess. 2:13) You can
also imitate Jesus by meditating on
the wonderful promises Jehovah
has made to you. (Heb. 12:2) See
these as God’s promises not just to
mankind in general but to you personally. w15 9/15 3:16, 17

Honor Jehovah with your valuable
things.—Prov. 3:9.
What are some ways that we can
show our love for God? Obviously,
we can use our material things to
support the Kingdom work locally and worldwide. This is certainly
a ?ne way to express love for Jehovah, whether we have much or little
materially. (2 Cor. 8:12) There are,
however, other ways to show Jehovah that we love him. Recall Jesus’
reminder to his followers not to be
anxious about food and clothing but
to keep on seeking ?rst the Kingdom. He said that the Father knows
what we really need. (Matt. 6:31-33)
The degree to which we trust that
promise is an indication of the
depth of our love for Jehovah because love and trust go hand in
hand. We cannot truly love someone
whom we do not trust. (Ps. 143:8)
So we might ask ourselves: ‘Do the
goals I pursue and my way of life re?ect that I truly love Jehovah? Do
my actions day in and day out show
that I trust his ability to care for my
needs?’ w15 9/15 5:7, 8

Wednesday, April 26
Without faith it is impossible to
please God well.—Heb. 11:6.
Have you ever thought, ‘Am I the
kind of person Jehovah will want
to save during the great tribulation
and bring into the new world?’ One
very important requirement is that
we cultivate strong faith. The
apostle Peter drew special attention to the importance of faith
when he spoke of its “tested quality” that “may be found a cause for
praise and glory and honor at the
revelation of Jesus Christ.” (1 Pet.

1:7) Since the great tribulation is
fast approaching, do we not want
to make sure that we have the type
of faith that puts us among those
whose faith will be praised by our
glorious King when he is revealed?
Most certainly, we want to be “the
sort who have faith for the preserving of our lives.” (Heb. 10:39) With
this goal in mind, we may plead like
the man who said: “Help me out
where I need faith!” (Mark 9:24) Or
we may be moved to say, as did Jesus’ apostles: “Give us more faith.”
—Luke 17:5. w15 10/15 2:1, 2

Thursday, April 27
Let us also throw o? every weight.
—Heb. 12:1.
Paul focused on “the more important things” and slaved in
God’s service, traveling back and
forth between Syria, Asia Minor, Macedonia, and Judea. “Forgetting the things behind and stretching forward to the things ahead, I
am pressing on toward the goal for
the prize,” wrote Paul. (Phil. 1:10; 3:
8, 13, 14) Taking full advantage of
his singleness, Paul succeeded in
being in “constant devotion to the
Lord without distraction.” (1 Cor. 7:
32-35) Like Paul, some servants of
God choose to remain single so that
they have fewer family responsibilities and can devote themselves to
Kingdom service. (Matt. 19:11, 12)
Married servants of God often have
more extensive family responsibilities. But whether single or married,
all can “throw o? every weight” and
serve God with as few distractions
as possible. This may require cutting down on time-wasting habits and setting goals to increase the
time spent in the service of God.

Wicked men and impostors will
advance from bad to worse.
—2 Tim. 3:13.
History has demonstrated beyond
any doubt the truthfulness of what
the Bible says: “I well know, O Jehovah, that man’s way does not belong to him. It does not belong to
man who is walking even to direct
his step.” (Jer. 10:23) No, Jehovah
did not create humans with the ability or the right to direct their affairs independent of him. In addition to showing how futile human
rule is, God’s temporary permission
of wickedness serves another longrange purpose. It provides permanent testimony that only God’s rule
can be successful. After Jehovah
destroys wickedness and those who
cause it, if anyone ever again would
challenge Jehovah’s way of ruling
in love, there would be no need for
God to permit the challenge to
stand. He could use what has happened in mankind’s history as
the just reason to remove such rebels quickly, not allowing them to establish wickedness once again.

May the God of peace . . . equip
you with every good thing to do his
will.—Heb. 13:20, 21.
Jesus loved to talk about God’s
Kingdom. According to the Bible
record, he spoke more about the
Kingdom than about any other subject—referring to it more than 100
times during his ministry. The Kingdom was truly dear to his heart.
(Matt. 12:34) Shortly after his resurrection, Jesus met with more than
500 prospective Kingdom proclaim-

ers. (1 Cor. 15:6) Perhaps it was on
that occasion that he gave the command to take the Kingdom message
to “people of all the nations”—a
daunting task back then! This great
work, Jesus foretold, would be carried on right up to “the conclusion
of the system of things,” and that
has proved to be the case. Quite
likely you are having a share in the
ful?llment of that commission and
prophecy. (Matt. 28:19, 20) And our
God has equipped us with “every
good thing” to help us ful?ll that
commission. w15 11/15 5:1-3

This is my name forever.
—Ex. 3:15.
Those who study ancient Hebrew
Bible manuscripts, such as the
Dead Sea Scrolls, are struck by
the many occurrences of the
Tetragrammaton—the four Hebrew
letters that represent God’s name.
The divine name appears not only in
those ancient Hebrew manuscripts
but also in some copies of the Greek
Septuagint from the second century B.C.E. through the ?rst century C.E. Despite the clear evidence
that the personal name of God
belongs in the Bible, many translations completely omit the sacred
name of God. In 1952, the Revised
Standard Version was published.
That version omitted the name, reversing the policy of the editors of
the American Standard Version of
1901. Why? The preface says:
“The use of any proper name for the
one and only God . . . is entirely inappropriate for the universal faith
of the Christian Church.” That set a
pattern for many subsequent translations, English and non-English.

They . . . [were] amazed at the
gracious words coming out of his
mouth.—Luke 4:22.
We can imitate Jesus’ gracious
speech by being kind, courteous,
and considerate of others’ feelings.
Seeing the e?ort a crowd made to
hear him speak, Jesus was moved
with pity and “started to teach
them many things.” (Mark 6:34) Even
when he was being insulted, Jesus did not resort to harsh speech.
(1 Pet. 2:23) Speaking with mildness
and tact can be a challenge when our
listener is someone whom we know
very well. We might feel at liberty to be very frank. That can be
true whether we speak with a family
member or a close friend in the congregation. Did Jesus feel that his
close relationship with his disciples
granted him liberty to speak harshly to them? Not at all! When his
closest followers continued to argue
over who was greater, Jesus corrected them with kind words and an
illustration of a young child. (Mark
9:33-37) Elders can imitate Jesus’ example by giving counsel “in a spirit
of mildness.”—Gal. 6:1. w15 12/15 3:

Tuesday, May 2
Let your brotherly love continue.
—Heb. 13:1.
Why is it vital that we let our
brotherly love continue? The simple
answer is that Jehovah requires us
to show brotherly love to one another. We cannot claim to love God and
at the same time refuse to love our
brothers. (1 John 4:7, 20, 21) Additionally, we need one another. This
is especially true in times of
trouble. Paul knew that some of the
Hebrew Christians to whom he was
writing would soon need to leave

their homes and material possessions. Jesus had described how dif?cult that time would be. (Mark
13:14 -18; Luke 21:21-23) So more
than ever before, those Christians needed to strengthen their affection for one another. (Rom. 12:9)
Soon the destructive winds of
the greatest tribulation of all time
will be released. (Mark 13:19; Rev.
7:1-3) It is not enough for us just to
meet together regularly. Paul reminded the Hebrew Christians that
they should use such occasions to
incite one another “to love and ?ne
works.”—Heb. 10:24, 25. w16.01 1:6-8

They all became ?lled with holy
spirit.—Acts 2:4.
The year was 33 C.E., and it was
the day of Pentecost. In an upper room in Jerusalem, a group of
about 120 Christians were gathered
together, “persisting in prayer.”
(Acts 1:13-15) What was about to
happen to them ful?lled a prophecy
uttered by the prophet Joel. (Joel 2:
28-32; Acts 2:16-21) God’s holy spirit was poured out on that group of
Christians who were gathered in the
upper room. (Acts 1:8) They started
to prophesy, or bear witness, concerning the wonderful things they
had seen and heard. To a multitude that soon gathered, the apostle Peter explained the signi?cance
of what had happened. Then he told
his audience: “Repent, and let each
one of you be baptized in the name
of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of
your sins, and you will receive the
free gift of the holy spirit.” Altogether about 3,000 accepted the invitation that day, were baptized, and
received the promised holy spirit.

Whoever eats the loaf or drinks the
cup of the Lord unworthily will be
guilty respecting the body and the
blood of the Lord.—1 Cor. 11:27.
What point is the apostle Paul
here making? An anointed Christian would partake unworthily if he
did not maintain a good relationship
with Jehovah. (Heb. 6:4-6; 10:2629) Such a warning helps anointed
Christians to remember that they
have not yet taken hold of the reward. They need to continue to
press on “toward the goal for the
prize of the upward call of God by
means of Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 3:1316) Under inspiration, Paul appealed
to anointed Christians “to walk worthily of the calling with which [they]
were called.” How should this be
done? Paul goes on to say “with
all humility and mildness, with patience, putting up with one another in love, earnestly endeavoring to
maintain the oneness of the spirit in
the uniting bond of peace.” (Eph. 4:
1-3) Jehovah’s spirit promotes humility, not pride.—Col. 3:12. w16.01

God put Abraham to the test.
—Gen. 22:1.
Picture an elderly man trudging up a mountainside. He is making
what must be the hardest journey of
his life. It is not his age that makes
this trek so daunting. Abraham may
be about 125 years old, but he is still
vigorous. Following him is a younger man, perhaps 25 years of age. It
is his son Isaac, who is carrying ?rewood. Abraham has a knife and the
means to start a ?re. Jehovah has
asked him to sacri?ce his own son!

(Gen. 22:1-8) Abraham was facing
what was likely the greatest test of
his faith. Abraham did not obey God
blindly. Instead, he obeyed because
he could see. With eyes of genuine
faith, he saw that his heavenly Father, Jehovah, never asks His faithful servants to do anything that will
result in their lasting harm. Abraham knew that if he obeyed Jehovah, his God would bless him and
his beloved son. On what was that
faith based? On knowledge and experience. w16.02 1:3, 4

Mary was to conceive, give birth
to, and raise the only-begotten Son
of God! It is easy to think only of
Mary’s wonderful privilege and fail
to consider some of the practical
concerns that might have seemed
daunting. God’s angel Gabriel told
her that she would become pregnant miraculously—without having
relations with a man. Gabriel
did not o?er to go to Mary’s family
and neighbors to explain the cause
of her pregnancy. What would they
think? Mary must have been concerned about her ?anc é, Joseph.
How could she convince him that,
although she was pregnant, she had
remained faithful to him? Moreover,
what a responsibility it would be
to raise, care for, and train the
only-begotten Son of the Most
High! We cannot know all the concerns that may have raced through
Mary’s mind when Gabriel spoke to
her. However, we do know that she
answered with the words of today’s
text.—Luke 1:26-37. w16.02 2:13, 14

Hushai the Archite was there to
meet him, with his robe ripped
apart and dirt on his head.
—2 Sam. 15:32.
A man named Hushai needed
courage to be loyal to God. Hushai was a loyal friend of King David. However, his loyalty was tested
when David’s son Absalom won the
heart of many and sought to take Jerusalem and the throne. (2 Sam. 15:
13; 16:15) David ?ed the city, but
what would Hushai do? Would he
switch his loyalty to Absalom, or
would he follow the elderly king who
was ?eeing for his life? Resolved
to be loyal to the king appointed
by God, Hushai met David on the
Mount of Olives. (2 Sam. 15:30) David asked Hushai to go back to Jerusalem, to pretend to be Absalom’s
friend, and to frustrate the advice
of Ahithophel. Risking his very life,
Hushai proved loyal to Jehovah and
did what David asked him to do. Just
as David had prayed, the counsel
of courageous Hushai did frustrate
that of Ahithophel.—2 Sam. 15:31; 17:

All these blessings will come upon
you and overtake you, because you
keep listening to the voice of Jehovah your God.—Deut. 28:2.
As Christians, we can bene?t
from the guidelines that were given in the Law to the nation of Israel. How so? We can stop and
look at the underlying principles of
the Law. Even though we are not under those laws, we can view many of
them as trustworthy guides in our
daily lives and our worship of our
holy God, Jehovah. He had those
laws recorded in the Bible so that

we could learn from them, be guided by the principles, and appreciate the higher moral standards for
Christians. Listen to what Jesus
said: “You heard that it was
said: ‘You must not commit adultery.’ But I say to you that everyone
who keeps on looking at a woman
so as to have a passion for her has
already committed adultery with
her in his heart.” Thus, we need to
avoid not only the act of adultery
but also the sexual craving to share
in immorality.—Matt. 5:27, 28. w16.03

Tuesday, May 9
Appoint for us a king to judge us.
—1 Sam. 8:5.
Samuel was so reluctant to do
what the people demanded that Jehovah three times saw the need to
tell him to listen to them. (1 Sam.
8:7, 9, 22) Even so, Samuel did
not allow bitterness or resentment
against the man who would replace
him to take root in his heart. When
Jehovah told him to anoint Saul,
the prophet obeyed, not reluctantly out of mere duty, but willingly out
of love. Like Samuel, experienced
elders today show a kind disposition toward those whom they train.
(1 Pet. 5:2) Such elders do not hold
back from training others for fear
of having to relinquish certain congregation privileges to the learners.
Bighearted teachers view willing
learners, not as competitors, but as
“fellow workers”—as precious gifts
to the congregation. (2 Cor. 1:24;
Heb. 13:16) And what satisfaction
such unsel?sh teachers experience
as they observe how the learners
use their abilities to bene?t the congregation!—Acts 20:35. w15 4/15 1:

I will discipline you to the proper
degree.—Jer. 30:11.
King Azariah “continued to do
what was right in Jehovah’s eyes.”
Yet, “Jehovah a?icted the king, and
he remained a leper until the day of
his death.” (2 Ki. 15:1-5) Why? The
account does not say. Should this
disturb us or cause us to wonder
whether Jehovah punished Azariah
without due cause? Not if we have
an intimate knowledge of Jehovah’s
ways. King Azariah was also known
as King Uzziah. (2 Ki. 15:7, 32) In the
parallel account at 2 Chronicles 26:
3-5, 16-21, we learn that although
Uzziah did what was right in Jehovah’s eyes for a time, later in life
“his heart became haughty to his
own ruin.” Presumptuously, he attempted to perform priestly duties
that were outside the scope of his
authority. Eighty-one priests confronted him and endeavored to correct him. How did Uzziah respond?
He demonstrated how proud he had
become. He “became enraged”
against the priests. No wonder Jehovah struck him with leprosy!

Down the great dragon was hurled,
the original serpent, the one called
Devil and Satan, who is misleading
the entire inhabited earth.
—Rev. 12:9.
As noted above, Satan is called
Devil, meaning “Slanderer.” This reminds us that Satan has defamed
Jehovah by calling him a liar. The
words “the original serpent” bring
to mind that tragic day in Eden
when Satan used a snake to deceive Eve. The expression “the great
dragon” brings to mind thoughts of

a terrifying monster and aptly ?ts
Satan’s savage craving to obstruct
Jehovah’s purpose and destroy His
people. Clearly, Satan poses the
greatest threat to our integrity. For
good reason, the Bible admonishes
us: “Keep your senses, be watchful! Your adversary, the Devil, walks
about like a roaring lion, seeking to
devour someone.” (1 Pet. 5:8) Satan
no doubt rejoices when one of God’s
servants becomes stained with serious sin and may use such victories to taunt Jehovah.—Prov. 27:11.

The love of money is a root of all
sorts of injurious things.
—1 Tim. 6:10.
Jehovah wants us to live comfortably—a fact that becomes clear when
we consider the beautiful surroundings that he provided for Adam and
Eve. (Gen. 2:9) But Satan can exploit our desires with “the deceptive
power of riches.” (Matt. 13:22) Many
think that money will make them
happy or that material possessions
are the key to success. Such thinking is pure deception, and it can
cause us to lose the most valuable
possession we have—our friendship with Jehovah. Jesus warned
his followers: “No one can slave for
two masters; for either he will hate
the one and love the other, or he
will stick to the one and despise
the other. You cannot slave for God
and for Riches.” (Matt. 6:24) If we
slave exclusively for Riches, we have
stopped serving Jehovah, and that
is precisely what Satan wants us to
do! May we never let money or the
things it can buy eclipse our friendship with Jehovah. To ?ght Satan,
we must maintain a balanced view
of material things.—1 Tim. 6:6-10.

If one member su?ers, all the other
members su?er with it.
—1 Cor. 12:26.
It is not always easy to understand the pain that others are experiencing. Many people face dif?culties that we have never known.
Some are challenged physically because of injury, disease, or aging. Others are coping with emotional trials because of depression,
panic attacks, or the aftere?ects of
abuse. Still others are part of a religiously divided family or a singleparent household. Everyone faces
some problem, and often it is one
we ourselves have not experienced. In such a case, how can we
imitate God’s love? By listening intently until we understand the other
person’s feelings, at least to some
extent. This will move us to imitate
Jehovah’s love by acting according
to the need. The need is di?erent
with each individual, but we may
be able to provide spiritual encouragement and some other practical
help.—Rom. 12:15; 1 Pet. 3:8. w15 5/15
4:6, 7

Sunday, May 14
Christ is the power of God.
—1 Cor. 1:24.
The Source of Christ’s power is
Jehovah himself, so we have reason to believe that Almighty
God is fully capable of controlling
the forces of nature. Consider a few
examples. Before the Flood, Jehovah stated: “In just seven days, I will
make it rain on the earth for 40 days
and 40 nights.” (Gen. 7:4) Similarly, at Exodus 14:21, we read: “Jehovah drove the sea back with a
strong east wind.” And we read at

Jonah 1:4: “Jehovah hurled a strong
wind at the sea, and there was such
a violent storm on the sea that the
ship was about to be wrecked.” It
is encouraging to know that Jehovah can control the elements. Clearly, planet Earth’s future is in good
hands. How wonderful it is to think
of the time when no natural forces
will kill or maim, for “the tent of
God [will be] with mankind”!
(Rev. 21:3, 4) We can be assured that
the power of God exercised through
Christ will control the forces of nature during the Millennium. w15 6/15

Monday, May 15
Stay far away from [the immoral
woman]; do not go near the entrance of her house.—Prov. 5:8.
The danger of disregarding this
counsel is illustrated in Proverbs chapter 7, where we read about
a young man who goes for a stroll
near the house of an immoral woman. They engage in sexual immorality. If only he had stayed far
away from her! (Prov. 7:6-27) Might
we at times show a similar lack of
good judgment, perhaps straying
into dangerous situations that could
awaken wrong desires? For example, at night, television networks
may relax their restrictions on program content. What if we occasionally channel surf? Or perhaps we
might aimlessly follow links on the
Internet or frequent chat rooms and
sites that carry invitations to view
pornography or o?er other sexual services. Could it be that in such
circumstances we would be confronted with something that would
arouse improper desires and undermine our ?ght to remain chaste?
w15 6/15 3:8, 9

Tuesday, May 16
Forgive us our debts.
—Matt. 6:12.
Why did Jesus use the word
“debts,” whereas on a later occasion, he spoke of “sins”? (Matt. 6:12;
Luke 11:4) Over 60 years ago,
The Watchtower nicely explained: “A
sin of transgression against God’s
law puts us in debt to him. . . . For
our sin God could demand and exact our lives. . . . He could withdraw his peace from us, breaking
o? all peaceful relations with us. . . .
We owe him love, expressed in obedience; and when we sin we fail in
paying our debt of love to him, for
sin is unloving toward God.” (1 John
5:3) Our daily need for forgiveness
highlights the only legal basis on
which God can cancel our sins—Jesus’ ransom sacri?ce. Though this
ransom was paid nearly 2,000 years
ago, we should cherish it as if it
were a gift given today. “The ransom price” for our lives “is so precious” that nothing any imperfect
human could do for us would come
near to paying it.—Ps. 49:7-9; 1 Pet.
1:18, 19. w15 6/15 5:9, 10

I will glorify the place for my feet.
—Isa. 60:13.
What a pleasure it is to o?er practical, appealing, and attractive literature in the ministry! And when we
use the latest technology to spread
the truth, such as by means of the
jw.org website, we re?ect Jehovah’s
interest in providing people everywhere with the guidance most of
them lack but so desperately need.
Not to be overlooked is the wisdom
behind the adjustment that allowed

us to have a Family Worship evening
or more time for personal study. We
also appreciate advances made in
assembly and convention programs. We often say that they get
better every year! And we certainly
rejoice over the increased training
being provided by our many theocratic schools. In all these adjustments, Jehovah’s hand is clearly seen. He progressively enhances
the beauty of his organization and
of the spiritual paradise that we enjoy even now! w15 7/15 1:16, 17

You must love . . . your neighbor
as yourself.—Luke 10:27.
If you are ever in doubt as to how
you ought to behave in any given situation, it would be wise to ask yourself, ‘What would Jesus have done?’
The nation in which Jesus lived was
made up of people from various regions—Judea, Galilee, Samaria, and
others. Bible accounts reveal that
there were tensions between people of these di?erent areas. (John
4:9) Tensions also existed between
Pharisees and Sadducees (Acts 23:
6-9), between the people and the tax
collectors (Matt. 9:11), and between
those who had received a Rabbinic education and those who had
not. (John 7:49) In the ?rst century, Israel was ruled by the Romans, whose presence was deeply
resented by the local people. While
Jesus championed religious truth
and acknowledged that salvation
originated with the Jews, he never
encouraged his disciples to foster
rivalries. (John 4:22) On the contrary, he urged them to love all men
as their neighbor. w15 7/15 3:5

Friday, May 19
Jehovah is on my side; I will not be
afraid. What can man do to me?
Jehovah is on my side as my
helper.—Ps. 118:6, 7.
Humans were created with the
need to love and be loved. It is easy
to become discouraged if this
need is not satis?ed because of unexpected events or disappointments, loss of health, ?nancial setbacks, or a lack of success in the
ministry. If we begin to feel that Jehovah no longer loves us, we do well
to remember that we are precious
to him and that he is there, “grasping [our] right hand” and helping
us. He will never forget us if we are
faithful to him. (Isa. 41:13; 49:15)
Brigitte, who raised two children
alone after her husband died,
states: “Raising children in Satan’s
system is one of the most di?cult
challenges, especially for a single
parent. But I am convinced of Jehovah’s love because he has guided me
through tears and heartache, and
he never let me experience more
than I could endure.”—1 Cor. 10:13.
w15 8/15 1:1-3

Saturday, May 20
Keep in expectation.
—Hab. 2:3.
The prophet Habakkuk was commissioned to foretell the destruction of Jerusalem. By the time he
arrived on the scene, warnings of
that city’s desolation had already
been sounded for years. Conditions
had reached the point where ‘the
wicked surrounded the righteous
and justice was perverted.’ So it is
not surprising that Habakkuk
asked: “How long, O Jehovah, must
I cry for help?” Jehovah assured his

faithful prophet that the foretold destruction would “not be late.”
(Hab. 1:1-4) Suppose Habakkuk had
become discouraged and thought: ‘I
have been hearing about Jerusalem’s destruction for years. What
if it is still a long way o? ? It does
not seem realistic to keep prophesying as if the city might suddenly be
destroyed. I will leave that to others.’ If Habakkuk had entertained
such ideas, he would have lost his
favored position before Jehovah
—and possibly his life during the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians! w15 8/15 2:12, 13

Sunday, May 21
Bad associations spoil useful
habits.—1 Cor. 15:33.
To avoid spoiling our useful habits, we must not have as close associates those who practice bad
things. This applies not only to associating with unbelieving wrongdoers but also to associating with
those who claim to worship Jehovah but who deliberately violate his
laws. If such professing Christians
engage in serious wrongdoing and
do not repent, we do not continue to
associate with them. (Rom. 16:17, 18)
If we were to associate with those
who do not obey God’s laws, we
might have the tendency to do
what they do in order to be accepted
by them. For example, if we were to
have close association with sexually
immoral people, we might be tempted to practice immorality. That has
happened to some dedicated Christians, and some of them were disfellowshipped because they were not
repentant. (1 Cor. 5:11-13) Unless
they repent, their condition can become like that described by Peter.
—2 Pet. 2:20-22. w15 8/15 4:4-6

You are my friends if you do what I
am commanding you.—John 15:14.
In choosing close friends, Jesus
was selective. Jesus chose such
friends from among those who loyally followed him and served Jehovah wholeheartedly. Do you similarly select your close friends
from among those who serve Jehovah unreservedly? Why is this important? The warmth of our brotherhood can help you to progress to
maturity. Perhaps you are a young
person who is trying to decide what
course you will pursue in life. How
wise you are if you associate with
fellow believers who have considerable experience in serving Jehovah and in contributing to the unity
of the congregation! Over the
years, they may have had some ups
and downs in life and may even have
faced challenges in serving God.
Such ones can help you to choose
the best way of life. Warm, upbuilding association with such
brothers and sisters can help you to
make your own wise decisions and
to press on to maturity.—Heb. 5:14.

Take your stand against [the
Devil], ?rm in the faith.
—1 Pet. 5:9.
By both word and deed, Jesus
built up the faith of his disciples.
(Mark 11:20-24) We should follow
his example because helping others
build up their faith also strengthens
our own. (Prov. 11:25) In your
preaching and teaching, highlight
the proof that God exists, that he
cares about us, and that the Bible is
his inspired Word. Help your brothers and sisters bolster their faith as

well. If any show signs of doubt, perhaps by starting to grumble against
appointed brothers, do not quickly
shun them. Instead, tactfully come
to their aid, helping them take steps
to restore their faith. (Jude 22, 23)
If you are in school and the theory
of evolution is discussed, boldly defend your faith in creation—you
might be surprised at the e?ect
your words have on others. Jehovah helps all of us to stand ?rm in
the faith. (1 Pet. 5:10) The e?ort we
put into building our faith is well
worth it, for the rewards of faith are
incomparable. w15 9/15 3:20, 21

The heavens are declaring the
glory of God; the skies above
proclaim the work of his
hands.—Ps. 19:1.
Today, we are blessed with much
knowledge of Jehovah’s works of
creation and the outworking of his
purpose. The world promotes higher education and advanced learning. Yet, the experience of many
shows that pursuing such things often leads to loss of faith and loss of
love for God. The Bible, however,
urges us not only to love knowledge
but also to acquire wisdom and understanding. That means to learn
how to use the knowledge that God
has given us so that we can bene?t
ourselves and others. (Prov. 4:5-7)
God’s “will is that all sorts of people
should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim.
2:4) We demonstrate our love for Jehovah when we put our heart into
telling everyone the Kingdom good
news and helping people to understand God’s grand purpose for mankind.—Ps. 66:16, 17. w15 9/15 5:10, 11

All the things that were written beforehand were written for our
instruction.—Rom. 15:4.
Imagine the following scenes
that reveal Elijah’s implicit trust
in Jehovah. When Elijah informed
King Ahab of Jehovah’s intention to
bring about a drought, he con?dently declared: “As surely as Jehovah . . .
is living, . . . there will be no dew or
rain except by my word!” (1 Ki. 17:1)
Elijah believed that Jehovah would
supply what was needed for him and
for others during the drought. (1 Ki.
17:4, 5, 13, 14) He expressed con?dence that Jehovah could raise a
child from the dead. (1 Ki. 17:21) He
had no doubt that Jehovah would
send ?re to consume his sacri?ce
on Mount Carmel. (1 Ki. 18:24, 37)
When Jehovah’s time came to end
the drought, even before there was
any sign of rain, Elijah told Ahab:
“Go up, eat and drink, for there is
the sound of a heavy downpour.”
(1 Ki. 18:41) Do not such accounts
make us examine ourselves to see if
our faith is that strong? w15 10/15

Ponder over these things.
—1 Tim. 4:15.
Man’s linguistic abilities are a miraculous gift designed by God.
(Ps. 139:14; Rev. 4:11) Our God-given
brain is unique in another important respect. Unlike animals, humans were created “in God’s image.” They have free will and
can choose to use their linguistic
skills to glorify God. (Gen. 1:27) To
all who desire to honor the Creator
of language, God has given a wonderful gift, the Bible. It is available

in whole or in part in over 2,800 languages. When you absorb these holy
writings, you are ?lling your mind
with the thoughts of God. (Ps.
40:5; 92:5; 139:17) Thus you can enjoy meditating on things that “are
able to make you wise for salvation.”
(2 Tim. 3:14-17) To meditate means
to focus your thoughts and to re?ect on or ponder over something, be it good or bad. (Ps. 77:12;
Prov. 24:1, 2) The two best subjects
for meditation are Jehovah God and
his Son, Jesus Christ.—John 17:3.

If any man does not know how to
preside over his own household,
how will he care for the congregation of God?—1 Tim. 3:5.
By word and example, Jesus
trained his disciples to serve others
humbly. (Luke 22:27) He taught his
apostles to be self-sacri?cing in Jehovah’s service and in dealing with
fellow believers. Through your example of humble self-sacri?ce, you
can teach your children the same
lesson. “I never felt jealous because
of the time my husband spent with
others as an elder,” says Debbie, a
mother of two. “I knew that whenever our family needed my husband’s attention, he would give it
to us.” Her husband, Pranas, adds:
“Later, our children were keen to
be involved at assemblies and on
theocratic projects. They ?ourished, made friends, and felt
that they belonged!” The entire family now serves Jehovah in the fulltime ministry. By the way you demonstrate humility and self-sacri?ce,
your children are likely to learn how
to serve others. w15 11/15 1:9

[God’s] invisible qualities are
clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are
perceived by the things made, even
his eternal power and Godship.
—Rom. 1:20.
Jehovah’s great love has been displayed in many ways. For example,
note the magni?cence of the universe. There are billions of galaxies,
each containing many billions of
stars and planets. In our own Milky
Way galaxy, one of those stars is our
sun, without which the multitude of
life forms on earth would not exist.
All these creations give evidence of
Jehovah’s Godship and of his qualities, such as his power, wisdom,
and love. On earth, Jehovah created everything for the bene?t of his
creatures designed for earthly life.
For humans, he made a beautiful
paradise garden and gave them perfect minds and bodies capable of
living forever. (Rev. 4:11) Moreover,
“he gives food to every living thing,
for his loyal love endures forever.”
—Ps. 136:25. w15 11/15 3:7, 8

I am with you.
—Matt. 28:20.
Over the years our King has given us tools to use to help prepare
the hearts of millions to receive the
Kingdom message. Some tools were
useful for perhaps a decade or so,
while others have proved to be of
timeless value. But all these tools
have allowed us to develop our
skills as evangelizers in some way.
One tool that helped many get started in the ministry was the testimony card, which Kingdom publishers

began using in 1933. The card contained a brief Bible message. The
testimony card was helpful in more
ways than one. Although having a
strong desire to share in the preaching work, some publishers were shy
and did not know what to say. Others would tell the householder
everything they knew in just a few
minutes, but their presentation was
not always tactful! In contrast, in a
few concise, well-chosen words, the
testimony card “did the talking” for
the publisher. w15 11/15 5:3-6

Let them praise the name of
Jehovah.—Ps. 148:13.
Countless Bible verses show the
importance of God’s name and its
sancti?cation. (Ex. 3:15; Ps. 83:18;
Isa. 42:8; 43:10; John 17:6, 26;
Acts 15:14) Jehovah God—the Author of the Bible—inspired its writers to use his name freely. (Ezek. 38:
23) Omitting the name, found
thousands of times in ancient manuscripts, shows disrespect for the
Author. The evidence for retaining
God’s name in the Bible has not diminished but grown. The 2013 revision of the New World Translation includes the name 7,216 times, which
is 6 more than the 1984 edition. Five
of the additional instances are
found at 1 Samuel 2:25; 6:3; 10:26;
23:14, 16. These were restored primarily because the Dead Sea
Scrolls, which predate the Hebrew
Masoretic text by over 1,000 years,
contain the name in these verses.
Also, one occurrence at Judges 19:
18 was restored as a result of further study of ancient manuscripts.

Let your brotherly love continue.
—Heb. 13:1.
We need to develop our brotherly
love now, for it will help us during
whatever tests and trials we may
face in the future. Even now, before
the outbreak of the great tribulation, we have a strong need for
brotherly love. Many of our brothers have been adversely a?ected by
earthquakes, ?oods, hurricanes,
tsunamis, or other natural disas-

ters. Some brothers are su?ering
because of opposition and persecution. (Matt. 24:6-9) Added to all of
this are the economic woes we experience daily as a result of living in
this corrupt system of things. (Rev.
6:5, 6) As such problems increase,
so do our opportunities to demonstrate the depth of our brotherly affection. Even though “the love of
the greater number [of people] will
grow cold,” we need to prove that
our brotherly love continues.—Matt.

A gentle tongue can break a bone.
—Prov. 25:15.

Tongues as if of ?re . . . came to
rest on each one of them.
—Acts 2:3.

Even when someone says something o?ensive, responding with
gracious words can have positive
results. (Prov. 15:1) For example,
the teenage son of a single mother was leading a double life. A wellmeaning Christian sister said to the
mother: “It’s too bad you have
failed at child training.” The mother
thought for a moment and responded: “It’s true that things are not
going well right now, but his training is a work in progress. Talk to
me after Armageddon; then we will
know for sure.” This mild response
helped to maintain peace between
the sisters, and it encouraged the
son, who overheard the conversation. He realized that his mother
had not given up on him. This
moved him to stop his bad associations. In time, he got baptized, and
he later served at Bethel. Whether in the company of our brothers,
our family, or strangers, we should
always let our words “be gracious,
seasoned with salt.”—Col. 4:6.

If you were one of the disciples
who experienced that, you would
never forget that day. There would
be no question in your mind that
you were anointed by holy spirit, especially if you also received the miraculous gift of speaking in a foreign language. (Acts 2:6-12) But do
all those who are anointed by holy
spirit receive their anointing in the
same spectacular manner as that
?rst group of about 120 disciples
did? No. The rest of those who were
present in Jerusalem that day received their anointing at their baptism. (Acts 2:38) There was no
tongue as if of ?re above their
heads. Furthermore, not all anointed Christians receive their anointing at their baptism. The Samaritans received their anointing
by holy spirit sometime after their
baptism. (Acts 8:14-17) On the other hand, in an exceptional instance,
Cornelius and his household were
anointed by holy spirit even before
they were baptized.—Acts 10:44-48.

Maintain the oneness of the spirit
in the uniting bond of peace.
—Eph. 4:3.
Modestly, anointed ones acknowledge that they do not necessarily have more holy spirit than those
with an earthly hope. They do not
claim to have special knowledge or
revelations; neither do they try to
prove that they are in some way superior. They would also never suggest to others that these too have
been anointed and should start partaking; rather, they would humbly
acknowledge that it is Jehovah who
does the calling of anointed ones.
Anointed Christians do not expect
any special honor from others.
(Eph. 1:18, 19; Phil. 2:2, 3) Jehovah’s
spirit bore witness to them personally. No announcement was made
to the world. So they are not surprised if some people do not readily believe that they have truly been
anointed by holy spirit. In fact, the
Scriptures advise against quickly
believing someone who claims to
have a special appointment from
God.—Rev. 2:2. w16.01 4:6, 7

Sunday, June 4
O the depth of God’s riches and
wisdom and knowledge!
—Rom. 11:33.
More than once, Jehovah stepped
in and protected Abraham and
Sarah, even doing so miraculously. (Gen. 12:10-20; 20:2-7, 10-12, 17,
18) Those experiences strengthened
Abraham’s faith. Can we build a
friendship with Jehovah? We can indeed! The needed knowledge and
experience are readily available.
Abraham had only a fraction of
the abundant riches of wisdom now
contained in the Bible. (Dan. 12:4)

God’s Word is full of treasures that
can deepen our knowledge about the
“Maker of heaven and earth” and
help us to build respect and love for
him. (Gen. 14:22) As such feelings
move us to obey God, we gain experience because we see how obeying
him works out. We ?nd that his counsel protects us and that he blesses
and strengthens us. We learn that
wholehearted service to God brings
ful?llment, peace, and joy. (Ps. 34:8;
Prov. 10:22) As we grow in such
knowledge and experience, our faith
in Jehovah and our friendship with
him grow as well. w16.02 1:7, 8

Monday, June 5
He has come to the aid of
Israel . . . , just as he spoke to
our forefathers.—Luke 1:54, 55.
Those words reveal that Mary
knew the inspired Scriptures well.
Her words seem to echo some
that were spoken in prayer by Hannah, the mother of the prophet Samuel. (1 Sam. 2:1-10) By one estimate,
Mary made some 20 references to
the Scriptures in her speech. Clearly, she was a woman who spoke freely about spiritual things. Mary drew
liberally from the treasure trove in
her heart, a storehouse of precious
truths that she had learned from
her greatest Friend, Jehovah God.
Like Mary, we may at times ?nd that
we receive assignments from Jehovah that seem challenging. Like her,
let us humbly put ourselves in Jehovah’s hands, trusting in him to act
in our best interests. We can imitate
Mary’s faith by listening carefully
to what we are learning about Jehovah and his purposes, by meditating on spiritual truths, and by joyously telling others about what we
have learned.—Ps. 77:11, 12; Luke 8:
18; Rom. 10:15. w16.02 2:17, 18

Who of you wanting to build a tower does not ?rst sit down and calculate the expense to see if he has
enough to complete it?
—Luke 14:28.
Every year thousands of young
people around the world get baptized. (Eccl. 12:1) Christian parents
and elders in the congregation want
to make sure that such young ones
make a decision that is not only voluntary but also well-founded. The
steps of dedication and baptism are
the start of a life during which
Christians will experience blessings from Jehovah but also opposition from Satan. (Prov. 10:22; 1 Pet.
5:8) Therefore, Christian parents
take time to teach their children
what is involved in being a disciple
of Christ. In the case of young ones
who have no Christian parents, the
elders in the congregation will lovingly help them to count the cost of
discipleship. (Luke 14:27-30) Just as
it takes planning to complete a
building project successfully, so it
requires preparation to serve Jehovah faithfully “to the end.”—Matt.
24:13. w16.03 1:1, 2

Wednesday, June 7
God is not partial, but in every nation the man who fears him and
does what is right is acceptable to
him.—Acts 10:34, 35.
The Mosaic Law was given to one
nation—?eshly Israel. In contrast,
spiritual Israel would be made up
of people from many nations and
backgrounds. The Mosaic Law governed ?eshly Israel in the Promised
Land with laws carved on stone. For
spiritual Israel, “the law of the
Christ” was mainly based on princi-

ples inscribed on hearts. “The law
of the Christ” would apply to and
bene?t Christians wherever they
lived. (Gal. 6:2) Spiritual Israel
would bene?t greatly from guidance from God through his Son.
Just prior to the establishment of
the new covenant, Jesus gave two
signi?cant commands. One dealt
with the preaching work. The other focused on the conduct of Jesus’
followers and how they were to
treat fellow believers. These directives were for all Christians;
thus they apply to all true worshippers today, whether their hope is
heavenly or earthly. w16.03 4:10, 11

Thursday, June 8
In showing honor to one another,
take the lead.—Rom. 12:10.
An elder should start his training
of another brother by taking time to
develop a relaxed atmosphere and
a bond of friendship with him. The
speci?c steps an elder takes will differ somewhat from land to land, depending on local circumstances and
customs. Yet, no matter where you
live, if you as a busy elder set aside
time to spend with a learner, you are
telling him, in e?ect, “You are important to me.” That unspoken message will be clearly understood and
deeply valued by willing learners
everywhere. A successful teacher
is someone who not only loves to
train another person but also loves
the person he is training. (Compare
John 5:20.) That crucial aspect of
a teacher’s disposition is quickly
discerned by a learner and greatly
a?ects the way he responds to the
training he receives. Therefore,
dear elders, as you give training, be
more than a teacher—be a friend.
—Prov. 17:17; John 15:15. w15 4/15 1:

Jehovah a?icted the king, and he
remained a leper until the day of
his death.—2 Ki. 15:5.
Suppose clarifying details concerning King Azariah (King Uzziah) had not been included in God’s
Word, as is the case with other abbreviated Bible accounts? (2 Ki. 15:
7, 32; 2 Chron. 26:3-5, 16-21) Would
you be inclined to question the righteousness of God? Or would you reason that the Bible contains enough
information to assure us that Jehovah always does what is right and is,
in fact, the very standard of what is
right and what is wrong? (Deut. 32:4)
As we get to know Jehovah better as
a Person, our love and appreciation
for his ways will grow to the point
that we do not need an explanation
for everything he does. Be assured
that such appreciation will grow in
proportion to your e?orts to study
and meditate on God’s communication through his written Word. (Ps.
77:12, 13) This, in turn, will strengthen your relationship with Jehovah,
making it ever more real. w15 4/15 3:

Saturday, June 10
Praise Jehovah, all you his angels,
mighty in power, who carry out his
word, obeying his voice.
—Ps. 103:20.
Spirit creatures called angels are
“mighty in power.” They are superior to humans and thus have greater intellect and strength. Of course,
faithful angels use their power for
good. For example, on one occasion
an angel of Jehovah struck down
185,000 enemy Assyrian soldiers—a
feat that would have been impossible for one human and di?cult even
for an entire army. (2 Ki. 19:35) On

another occasion an angel used his
superhuman power and ingenuity
to release Jesus’ apostles from jail.
That spirit creature eluded security measures, unlocked the doors,
let out the apostles, and then locked
the doors behind them—all of that
while guards were stationed nearby! (Acts 5:18-23) Whereas faithful
spirit creatures use their power for
good, Satan uses his power for evil.
And what power and in?uence he
has! The Scriptures refer to him as
“the ruler of this world.”—John 12:
31. w15 5/15 1:5, 6

Sunday, June 11
None of you should become hardened by the deceptive power of sin.
—Heb. 3:13.
Whether married or single, we
must strenuously resist all forms of
sexual immorality. Is the ?ght easy?
By no means! If you are a young person, for instance, you might hear
your schoolmates boast about having casual sex or about sexting, a
practice that in some places is
viewed as being tantamount to distributing child pornography. The Bible says: “Whoever practices sexual immorality is sinning against his
own body.” (1 Cor. 6:18) Both su?ering and death have resulted from
the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases. And the majority of unmarried youths who lose their virginity say that they regret what they
did. The reality of immoral sex is
far di?erent from what is portrayed
by the entertainment media, which
would have us believe that breaking
God’s laws has no consequences.
Such thinking makes people fall victim to “the deceptive power of sin.”
w15 5/15 2:14

Monday, June 12
The Most High . . . is kind toward
the unthankful and wicked.
—Luke 6:35.
Jesus imitated God’s kindness.
What helped Jesus to do so? He
treated people in a kind manner by
anticipating how his words and actions might a?ect another individual’s feelings. For example, a woman
known to be a sinner approached
him, weeping and wetting his feet
with her tears. Jesus discerned that
she was repentant, and he knew
how heartbroken she would be if he
dismissed her unkindly. Instead, he
commended and forgave her. When
a Pharisee disapproved of what had
happened, Jesus spoke to him kindly too. (Luke 7:36-48) How can we imitate God’s kindness? The apostle
Paul wrote: “A slave of the Lord does
not need to ?ght, but needs to be
gentle [or, “tactful,” ftn.] toward all.”
(2 Tim. 2:24) By putting ourselves in
the place of others and trying to anticipate how our words might a?ect
them, we can discern how to speak
and act in ways that imitate Jehovah’s kindness.—Prov. 15:28. w15 5/15
4:8, 9

Tuesday, June 13
Do not withhold good from those
to whom you should give it if it is
within your power to help.
—Prov. 3:27.
When our brothers su?er hardships, we can comfort and support
them physically, emotionally, and
spiritually. (Prov. 17:17) For example, we may help them recover from
a natural disaster. Listen to one widow’s heartfelt expression of thanks
after a hurricane badly damaged
her home: “I am so deeply grateful

to be in Jehovah’s organization, not
only for the physical help but also
for the spiritual help.” And note the
comments of one single sister who
felt hopeless and perplexed after
seeing the damage done to her
home by a storm. Upon receiving
help, she said: “It is indescribable! I
am unable to express totally how I
feel . . . Thank you, Jehovah!” We rejoice that we are part of a brotherhood that genuinely cares about the
needs of others. A greater cause for
gladness is that Jehovah and Jesus
Christ really care for God’s people.

[Treat] older women as mothers,
. . . younger women as sisters, with
all chasteness.—1 Tim. 5:2.
The Bible helps us to avoid improper desires by giving counsel on
how to treat those of the opposite
sex. Such counsel clearly rules out
?irting. Some may view the use of
body language, gestures, and
glances that have romantic overtones as harmless in that these do
not involve any physical contact.
But ?irting, or responding to it, may
arouse unclean thoughts that can
lead to serious sexual wrongdoing.
It has happened before—it can
happen again. Joseph acted wisely
in this regard. When the wife of his
master, Potiphar, tried to seduce
him, Joseph rejected her e?orts.
But she did not give up. Day after
day she invited him to remain with
her. (Gen. 39:7, 8, 10) However, Joseph was determined never to encourage, or even tolerate, her seductive overtures, thus preventing
any wrong desire from taking root
in his heart. w15 6/15 3:10, 11

Thursday, June 15
Forgive us our debts, as we also
have forgiven our debtors.
—Matt. 6:12.
Jehovah wants us to be concerned not only about our own spiritual welfare but also about that of
others, including those who might
have sinned against us. Usually,
such sins are minor and give us an
opportunity to show that we truly
love our brothers and are willing to
forgive, as God has mercifully forgiven us. (Col. 3:13) Sadly, as imperfect humans, we may sometimes
harbor a grudge against another.
(Lev. 19:18) If we talk about the matter, others may side with us, causing a division in the congregation.
If we allow such a situation to continue, it would show a lack of appreciation for God’s mercy and the
ransom. Our Father will cease to apply to us the value of his Son’s sacri?ce if we display an unforgiving
spirit. (Matt. 18:35) Jesus elaborated on this immediately after giving
the model prayer. (Matt. 6:14, 15)
Finally, to bene?t from God’s forgiveness, we must strive to avoid
making a practice of serious sin.
—1 John 3:4, 6. w15 6/15 5:9-11

The king ?nds pleasure in a
servant who acts with
insight.—Prov. 14:35.
It is an honor to be allowed by Jehovah to contribute to the beauty of
our spiritual paradise. We do that
by zealously preaching the Kingdom
good news and making more disciples. Each time we help a person
progress to Christian dedication, we
have worked to extend the borders
of the spiritual paradise. (Isa. 26:15;
54:2) We can also enhance the beau-

ty of our spiritual paradise by steadily improving our own Christian personality. In that way, we make this
paradise more appealing to onlookers. More than even Bible knowledge, it is often our chaste, peaceful
conduct that initially draws people
to the organization and in turn to
God and to Christ. How pleased Jehovah and Jesus must be when they
observe our beautiful spiritual paradise today! The enjoyment we have
now in working to enhance its beauty is but a foretaste of the joy we will
have later in working to make the
earth a physical paradise. w15 7/15 1:

You will be like God, knowing good
and bad.—Gen. 3:5.
Today, all must decide whether
they believe that God’s way of doing
things is superior to Satan’s or vice
versa. In all sincerity, do you take
Jehovah’s side by choosing to obey
his laws and standards instead of
doing things your own way? Do you
see his Kingdom as the only answer
to mankind’s woes? Or do you believe that man is capable of governing himself? Your answers to these
questions will determine how you
respond when people ask your opinion on controversial matters. Politicians, activists, and reformers have
long struggled to ?nd solutions to
divisive issues. Their e?orts may
be sincere and well-motivated. Yet,
Christians recognize that only
God’s Kingdom can solve mankind’s problems and guarantee true
justice. We must leave the matter in
Jehovah’s hands. After all, if each
Christian advocated the solution
he thought best, would not our congregations soon become divided?

I will meditate on all your activity.
—Ps. 77:12.
Can we see Jehovah’s enduring
love for us in what he has created?
Yes, we can because the very act
of creation was a manifestation of
God’s love. (Rom. 1:20) He designed the earth with an ecosystem in which we can safely exist and
thrive. However, he wants us to do
more than merely exist. We need to
eat to keep on living. Jehovah made
sure that the earth could produce a
seemingly endless variety of plants
that can be prepared as wholesome
food. Why, he even made eating a
delightful and satisfying experience! (Eccl. 9:7) Jehovah created us
with the ability to perform productive and meaningful work that adds
to our enjoyment of life. (Eccl. 2:24)
He purposed that humans ?ll the
earth, subdue it, and have in subjection the ?sh, the birds, and other
living creatures. (Gen. 1:26-28) And
how loving of Jehovah to endow us
with qualities that enable us to imitate him!—Eph. 5:1. w15 8/15 1:4, 5

Pay attention to yourselves that
your hearts never become weighed
down . . . and suddenly that day
be instantly upon you as a snare.
—Luke 21:34, 35.
Events on the world scene clearly
indicate that Bible prophecy is now
being ful?lled and that the end of
this wicked system of things is imminent. Therefore, we should not
assume that much time is needed
for the state of this world to develop
to the point where “the ten horns”

and “the wild beast” of Revelation
17:16 turn on Babylon the Great, the
world empire of false religion. Let
us bear in mind that God will “put it
into their hearts” to make that move
—and this could happen swiftly and
at any time! (Rev. 17:17) The end of
this entire system of things is not
far o?. With good reason, we should
heed Jesus’ warning as given in today’s text. (Rev. 16:15) Let us be resolved to serve Jehovah with a
sense of urgency, con?dent that he
“acts in behalf of those who keep
in expectation of him.”—Isa. 64:4.

Whoever does the will of God, this
one is my brother and sister and
mother.—Mark 3:35.
Although we want to be kind even
to those who do not follow God’s
laws, we should not become their intimate associates or close friends. It
would therefore be wrong for one of
Jehovah’s Witnesses who is a single
person to date such an individual
who is not dedicated and faithful to
God and who does not respect His
high standards. Maintaining Christian integrity is far more important
than becoming popular with people who do not live by Jehovah’s
laws. Our close associates should
be those who do God’s will. The
disastrous results of bad associations were experienced by the Israelites. (Ex. 23:24, 25; Ps. 106:35-39)
Because they became unfaithful to
God, Jesus later told them: “Look!
Your house is abandoned to you.”
(Matt. 23:38) Jehovah cast o? Israel,
transferring his blessing to the newly formed Christian congregation.
—Acts 2:1-4. w15 8/15 4:7, 8

The objective of this instruction is
love out of a clean heart and out
of a good conscience.—1 Tim. 1:5.
Jehovah God created humans
with free will, that is, the liberty
to choose between one option and
another. God provided a valuable
guide for the ?rst man and woman
and their future o?spring—the
conscience, an inner sense of right
and wrong. Used properly, the conscience can help us to do good and
to avoid wrongdoing. Our conscience thus is an evidence of God’s
love for us and of his desire that humans be united in doing good. Today, humans still have the faculty of
conscience. (Rom. 2:14, 15) Though
many have strayed far from the Bible’s standards of conduct, we ?nd
that some individuals often do what
is good and abhor what is bad. The
conscience holds many individuals
back from committing deeds of extreme wickedness. Imagine how
much worse world conditions would
be if no one had a conscience! How
grateful we can be that God has provided humans with a conscience!
w15 9/15 2:1, 2

Thursday, June 22
See what sort of love the Father
has given us!—1 John 3:1.
This statement by the apostle
John is truly worthy of our deep
and appreciative re?ection. With
the words “see what sort of love the
Father has given us,” John was urging Christians to think about the nature and magnitude of God’s love
for them, to consider how God loves
them. Comprehending Jehovah’s
love in those terms will surely deepen our love for him and strengthen
our relationship with him. To some,

though, God’s love for people is a
foreign concept. To them, God is to
be feared and obeyed. Or perhaps
because of certain entrenched erroneous teachings, they feel that God
is unloving, even unlovable. On the
other hand, there are those who believe that God’s love is unconditional and that he loves them regardless
of what they do or fail to do. As you
studied the Bible, you learned that
love is Jehovah’s paramount attribute and that his love moved him to
give his Son as a ransom in our behalf.—John 3:16; 1 John 4:8. w15 9/15
4:1, 2

Friday, June 23
Discipline . . . is painful.
—Heb. 12:11.
In saying so, Paul was not minimizing the importance or value of
discipline, for he continued: “Yet
afterward, it yields the peaceable
fruit of righteousness to those who
have been trained by it.” If we love
Jehovah, we must guard against becoming complacent or resentful of
his counsel. In today’s me-?rst, selfcentered generation, it is not easy
to talk about counsel and discipline,
let alone to accept such. Even those
who seem to accept counsel or discipline often do so begrudgingly.
Christians, though, are advised to
“stop being molded by this system
of things.” We are to perceive and
follow the “perfect will of God.”
(Rom. 12:2) Through his organization, Jehovah gives us timely counsel about many areas of life—our
conduct with the opposite sex, our
associations, and our recreation.
By willingly accepting and applying
such direction, we show that we are
grateful and that we truly love Jehovah from the heart.—John 14:31;
Rom. 6:17. w15 9/15 5:13, 15

Saturday, June 24
Help me out where I need faith!
—Mark 9:24.
We cannot develop faith simply by
our own willpower. Faith is an aspect of the fruitage of God’s holy
spirit. (Gal. 5:22) Thus, we are wise
to follow Jesus’ counsel about praying for more of that spirit because Jesus assures us that the Father will “give holy spirit to those
asking him.” (Luke 11:13) Once our
faith is established, we must continue to nourish it. Our faith might be
compared to a wood ?re. When the
?re is started, it may come roaring
to life in an intense blaze. However,
if nothing more is done to the ?re, it
will eventually die down to hot coals
that, in turn, will become cold ashes if left alone. But if you regularly
feed the ?re with more wood, it can
be kept going inde?nitely. So, too,
our faith can be kept alive if we regularly feed on God’s Word. By progressively studying the Bible, we
can develop a deep love for it and its
Author, and that will become the basis for building more faith. w15 10/15

I will meditate on all your activity.
—Ps. 77:12.
Scienti?c research shows that
saying words aloud during study
makes them easier to recall. The
Creator of our brain knows this.
That is why he instructed Joshua
to read His book of the Law “in
an undertone.” (Josh. 1:8) You will
likely ?nd that reading the Bible
softly, or in an undertone, makes a
deeper impression on your mind.
This may also help you to con-

centrate better. While reading may
be done with little e?ort, meditation requires concentration. That
is why the imperfect human brain is
inclined to switch to easier, less demanding tasks. Thus, the best time
to meditate is when you are rested and in a stress-free environment
with few distractions. The psalmist found that a good time to meditate was while he was awake in
bed during the night. (Ps. 63:6) Jesus, who had perfect mental powers,
knew the advantage of being in quiet
places to meditate and pray.—Luke
6:12. w15 10/15 4:4, 6, 7

Monday, June 26
He knew what was in man.
—John 2:25.
On one occasion, some of Jesus’
listeners in Galilee appeared eager
to follow him. (John 6:22-24) But Jesus, who could read hearts, discerned that the people were more
interested in physical food than in
what he taught. He saw what was
wrong, patiently corrected them,
and explained how they could improve. (John 6:25-27) Although
you cannot read hearts, you too can
show insight and learn how your
child feels about the ?eld ministry.
Many parents include short breaks
during ?eld service to allow their
children to rest and enjoy some refreshments. Yet, you might look beyond the obvious and ask yourself,
‘Does my child enjoy the ministry or
only the breaks?’ If you discern that
the ministry could be more interesting or more rewarding for your children, set goals with them. Use creativity to help them to have a full
share as your preaching companions. w15 11/15 1:10, 11

The former things have passed
away.—Rev. 21:4.
Our loving God always does what
is in the best interests of his faithful
servants. The Bible tells us: “He will
wipe out every tear from their eyes,
and death will be no more, neither
will mourning nor outcry nor pain
be anymore.” What a marvelous future awaits all of us who truly appreciate Jehovah’s love and obey
him as our Ruler! Jehovah’s Word
tells us: “Take note of the blameless one, and keep the upright one
in sight, for the future of that man
will be peaceful. But all the transgressors will be destroyed.” (Ps. 37:
37, 38) “The blameless one” comes
to know Jehovah and his Son and
obediently does God’s will. (John
17:3) Such a person takes seriously
the words of 1 John 2:17: “The world
is passing away and so is its desire,
but the one who does the will of God
remains forever.” As the world’s end
draws near, it is urgent that we
“hope in Jehovah and follow his
way.”—Ps. 37:34. w15 11/15 3:11, 12

The harvest is great, but
the workers are few.
—Matt. 9:37.
God’s people have used a variety
of methods in order to reach as
many as possible with the good
news. This was especially important when ‘the workers were few.’
In the early 20th century, newspapers were used to reach large audiences in areas where Jehovah’s
people were few in number. Each
week, Charles Taze Russell would
telegraph a sermon to a newspaper

syndicate. In turn, the syndicate retelegraphed the sermon to newspapers in the United States, Canada, and Europe. It is estimated that
by 1913, Brother Russell’s sermons
were reaching 15,000,000 readers
by means of 2,000 newspapers! After Brother Russell died, another
e?ective method of spreading the
good news began to be used. On
April 16, 1922, Joseph F. Rutherford
made one of his ?rst radio broadcasts, speaking to an estimated 50,000 people. Then, on February 24,
1924, the organization’s ?rst radio
station, WBBR, began broadcasting.

I Will Become What I Choose to
Become.—Ex. 3:14.
Jehovah also causes his creation
to become whatever he chooses. In
line with the meaning of his name,
God caused Noah to be an ark builder, Bezalel to be a master craftsman, Gideon to be a victorious warrior, and Paul to be an apostle to the
nations. Yes, God’s name has great
meaning to his people. And the New
World Bible Translation Committee would never undermine the
name’s signi?cance by omitting it
from the Bible. Over 130 language
editions of the New World Translation honor God’s name by including it where it belongs in the sacred
text. (Mal. 3:16) In contrast, the current trend in Bible translation is to
omit the divine name, substituting
a title such as “Lord” or the name
of a local god. This is a prime reason why the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses has given priority to making available to as many
people as possible a Bible that honors God’s name. w15 12/15 2:7-9

No resident will say: “I am sick.”
—Isa. 33:24.
There is no doubt that God has
the power to a?ect someone’s
health. The Bible con?rms that. At
times, he punished individuals with
sickness, such as the Pharaoh in
Abraham’s day and later Moses’ sister, Miriam. (Gen. 12:17; Num. 12:9,
10; 2 Sam. 24:15) God warned that if
the Israelites proved unfaithful, he
would a?ict them with “every sickness or plague.” (Deut. 28:58-61) On
the other hand, Jehovah could re-

move diseases or prevent sickness.
(Ex. 23:25; Deut. 7:15) Also, he could
heal people. After Job had been so
sick that he longed to die, God
healed him! (Job 2:7; 3:11-13; 42:10,
16) Yes, God de?nitely has the power to intervene and heal a sick person. It is similar with his Son. We
read that Jesus miraculously cured
lepers, epileptics, and blind or paralyzed ones. (Matt. 4:23, 24; John 9:
1-7) How strengthening it is to think
that the healings Jesus performed
are a foregleam of what he will do
on a grand scale in the new world.

Do not forget hospitality.
—Heb. 13:2.

You were sealed by means of him
with the promised holy spirit,
which is a token in advance of our
inheritance.—Eph. 1:13, 14.

The original-language expression
translated “hospitality” means
“kindness to strangers.” This phrase
may remind us of the examples of
Abraham and Lot. Both men showed
kindness to visitors whom they did
not know. These visitors turned out
to be angels. (Gen. 18:2-5; 19:1-3) Do
we too extend hospitality to others
by inviting them to our home for a
meal or for some association and encouragement? We would not need
to make elaborate or expensive arrangements to be considered hospitable; nor would we want to invite
only those who might repay us in
some way. (Luke 10:42; 14:12-14) Our
goal should be to encourage, not to
impress! Even though we may not
know our circuit overseer and his
wife very well, do we eagerly show
them hospitality? (3 John 5-8) With
our busy schedules as well as the
stresses of daily living, how important it is that we “do not forget hospitality”! w16.01 1:11, 12

This special operation of holy
spirit becomes like a down payment,
a guarantee (or, a pledge) of what
is to come. An anointed Christian
gains an inner conviction because of
this token. (2 Cor. 1:21, 22; 5:5) That
person is sure of his invitation. But
whether he ?nally receives his reward in heaven or not depends on
his proving faithful to his calling.
Peter explained it this way: “Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to make your calling and choosing sure for yourselves, for if you
keep on doing these things, you will
by no means ever fail. In fact, in
this way you will be richly granted
entrance into the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ.” (2 Pet. 1:10, 11) Each anointed Christian must, therefore, struggle to remain faithful. If he does not,
his heavenly calling, or invitation,
will be of no value to him.—Heb. 3:1;
Rev. 2:10. w16.01 3:6, 7

Monday, July 3
Whoever exalts himself will be
humbled, and whoever humbles
himself will be exalted.
—Matt. 23:12.
It would be wrong to exalt individuals, even if they are anointed
brothers of Christ. Speaking about
Christian elders, the Bible encourages us to imitate the faith of
those who take the lead, but it never
commands us to elevate any human
as our leader. (Heb. 13:7) True, the
Scriptures speak of some as being
“considered worthy of double honor.” However, such ones are worthy
of honor, not because they are
anointed, but because they “preside in a ?ne way” and “work hard
in speaking and teaching.” (1 Tim.
5:17) Therefore, it would be embarrassing for those with a heavenly
calling if others were to give them
undue praise or attention. Worse
still, if they received special treatment, anointed Christians might
?nd it di?cult to remain humble.
(Rom. 12:3) None of us would want
to cause one of Christ’s brothers to
stumble!—Luke 17:2. w16.01 4:9

Tuesday, July 4
A true friend shows love at all
times.—Prov. 17:17.
A friendship can be a precious
treasure. However, friendship is
not like an inanimate thing that we
might purchase and then store
somewhere to gather dust. Friendship is more like a living thing that
needs care and sustenance if it is to
thrive and ?ourish. Abraham cherished and maintained his friendship
with Jehovah. How did he do so?
Abraham never came to feel that his

past record of godly fear and obedience was enough. As he and his
large household traveled into Canaan, he continued to let Jehovah
guide him in making decisions, from
the small to the great. A year before
Isaac was born, when Abraham was
99 years old, Jehovah required that
all males of Abraham’s household
be circumcised. Did Abraham question that command or look for some
way out of complying with it? No, he
trusted in God and obeyed “on that
very day.”—Gen. 17:10-14, 23. w16.02
1:9, 10

Wednesday, July 5
Even a child is known by his
actions, whether his behavior is
pure and right.—Prov. 20:11.
One who is somewhat younger can
realize what it means to do what
is right and to be dedicated to his
Creator. Thus, baptism is an important and appropriate step for a
young person who has manifested
considerable maturity and has made
a dedication to Jehovah. (Prov. 20:7)
What does it mean to be mature?
Maturity involves more than physical growth. The Bible says that mature people “have their powers of
discernment trained to distinguish
both right and wrong.” (Heb. 5:14)
Thus, mature people know what is
right in Jehovah’s eyes and are resolved in their heart to stick to it. As a
result, they are not easily swayed to
do what is wrong; nor do they always
have to be prodded to do what is
right. Really, it is only reasonable
to expect that a young person who
gets baptized will uphold God’s standards even when parents or other
adults are not present.—Phil. 2:12.
w16.03 1:4, 5

Thursday, July 6
Do not be afraid . . . ; you will be
king over Israel, and I will become
second to you.—1 Sam. 23:17.
Jonathan must have been astonished by the way young David faced
the giant Goliath. Now David stood
before Jonathan’s father, King Saul
of Israel, “with the head of the Philistine in his hand.” (1 Sam. 17:
57) Jonathan probably admired David for his courage. It was clear that
God was with David, and “Jonathan
and David became bound together
in close friendship.” In fact, they
“made a covenant because [Jonathan] loved [David] as himself.”
(1 Sam. 18:1-3) For the rest of
his life, he was loyal to David.
Jonathan’s attachment to David endured, even though God had chosen
David to be Israel’s next king. Jonathan became concerned about David when Saul was seeking to kill
him. To encourage his friend, Jonathan traveled into the Judean wilderness at Horesh. There, Jonathan
helped David “?nd strength in Jehovah,” saying the words of today’s
text.—1 Sam. 23:16. w16.02 3:1, 2

Friday, July 7
I was beside [Jehovah] as a master
worker. I was the one he was especially fond of day by day.
—Prov. 8:30.
From the beginning of creation,
unity of purpose was evident. Father and Son collaborated, and they
produced the variety of life we observe today. Cooperation continued
to mark God’s works. We see this
quality in the building of the ark in
Noah’s day; the erecting, dismantling, and moving of the tabernacle as God’s people journeyed in the

wilderness; and even in the playing of music and blending of voices in harmonious praise to Jehovah
at his temple. All those endeavors
depended on cooperation. (Gen. 6:
14-16, 22; Num. 4:4-32; 1 Chron. 25:
1-8) This pattern of working together characterized the early Christian
congregation under its head, Jesus
Christ. The apostle Paul explained
that, even though individual anointed Christians had “di?erent gifts”
and shared in “di?erent ministries”
and “di?erent activities,” all were
part of “one body.”—1 Cor. 12:4-6, 12.
w16.03 3:1, 2

Saturday, July 8
Go, therefore, and make disciples
of people of all the nations.
—Matt. 28:19.
Consider the preaching of the
good news that Jesus would have
his followers do. The method and
the scope of the preaching work
were new. In earlier centuries, people of the nations were welcomed
when they came to Israel to serve Jehovah. (1 Ki. 8:41-43) That was before Jesus gave the command found
in today’s text. Jesus’ disciples
were told to “go” to all people. On
the day of Pentecost 33 C.E., there
was an early evidence of Jehovah’s
changed strategy—that of a global evangelizing work. His holy spirit empowered about 120 members of
the new congregation to speak miraculously in di?erent tongues to
Jews and proselytes. (Acts 2:4-11)
Next, the territory expanded to the
Samaritans. Then, in the year
36 C.E., it was further expanded
to include the world of uncircumcised Gentiles. You might say that
the ?eld of preaching enlarged from
a “pond” of Jews to an “ocean” of
mankind. w16.03 4:12

Sunday, July 9
The things you heard from me
. . . , entrust to faithful men.
—2 Tim. 2:2.
God’s servants have long understood that training contributes to
success. The patriarch Abram “mobilized his trained men” to rescue Lot—and the men succeeded.
(Gen. 14:14-16) In King David’s day,
the singers for God’s house “were
trained in song to Jehovah” and
brought praise to God. (1 Chron.
25:7) Today, we are ?ghting a spiritual war against Satan and his followers. (Eph. 6:11-13) Also, we are
exerting ourselves in our e?ort to
bring praise to Jehovah. (Heb. 13:
15, 16) Hence, like God’s servants
in the past, to be successful we
need to be trained. In the congregation, Jehovah entrusts the elders
with the responsibility of training
others. Before teaching a less experienced brother a set of skills,
an elder may discern the need to
share some nourishing Scriptural
thoughts with him so as to make
his heart more responsive to the
training he will receive.—1 Tim. 4:6.
w15 4/15 2:1, 2

Monday, July 10
[Jesus will] bring to nothing the
one having the means to cause
death, that is, the Devil.
—Heb. 2:14.
This does not mean that the Devil
kills all people directly. However,
his murderous spirit has permeated
this world. Moreover, because Eve
believed Satan’s lie and Adam disobeyed God, sin and death spread
to all mankind. (Rom. 5:12) In that
sense, the Devil has had “the means
to cause death.” He is what Jesus called him—“a murderer.” (John
8:44) What a powerful enemy we

have in Satan! When we oppose Satan, we align ourselves against not
only him but all those who side with
him in the issue of universal sovereignty. That number includes a
sizable group of other spirit rebels, or demons. (Rev. 12:3, 4) Time
and again, the demons have demonstrated their superhuman strength,
causing great misery to those whom
they have tormented. (Matt. 8:28-32;
Mark 5:1-5) Never underestimate the
power of such wicked angels or that
of “the ruler of the demons.” (Matt.
9:34) Without help from Jehovah, we
could never win our ?ght against Satan. w15 5/15 1:6, 7

Tuesday, July 11
Those who are sexually immoral,
idolaters, adulterers, men who submit to homosexual acts, men who
practice homosexuality, thieves,
greedy people, drunkards, revilers,
and extortioners will not inherit
God’s Kingdom.—1 Cor. 6:9, 10.
If you struggle with temptation
to engage in sexual immorality,
what can you do? Acknowledge your
weakness. (Rom. 7:22, 23) Pray to
God for strength. (Phil. 4:6, 7, 13)
Avoid situations that could lead to
immorality. (Prov. 22:3) And when
a temptation arises, reject it without delay. (Gen. 39:12) Jesus set a
powerful example for us in resisting
temptations. He was not fooled by
Satan’s promises, nor did he have to
take time to weigh the pros and cons.
Rather, he immediately responded
with the words: “It is written.” (Matt.
4:4-10) Jesus knew God’s Word, and
that made it possible for him to act
quickly and quote scriptures in the
face of temptation. To ?ght Satan
and win, we must not allow ourselves
to be tempted to engage in sexual
immorality. w15 5/15 2:15, 16

Wednesday, July 12
Become imitators of God.
—Eph. 5:1.
Our being able to conceive of
events that we have not lived
through can help us to imitate Jehovah’s wisdom and foresee the probable results of our actions. If Jehovah chooses to do so, he can
foresee in detail the results of certain actions. We do not have that degree of foresight, but we do well to
think about what could happen as a
result of what we are about to do.
To imitate God’s wisdom, we would
do well to think about or even visualize the likely consequences of
our actions. If we are courting, for
example, we need to recognize the
power of sexual attraction. Never
would we make plans or do anything
that could endanger our precious
relationship with Jehovah! Instead,
let us act in harmony with these inspired words: “The shrewd one sees
the danger and conceals himself,
but the inexperienced keep right on
going and su?er the consequences.”
—Prov. 22:3. w15 5/15 4:10, 11

Thursday, July 13
Everyone who keeps on looking at
a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed
adultery with her in his heart.
—Matt. 5:28.
Recall what happened in King David’s case. “From the rooftop [David] saw a woman bathing.” (2 Sam.
11:2) He failed to look away and to
direct his thoughts elsewhere.
That led him to desire a woman who
was someone else’s wife and to take
steps to commit adultery with her.
In order to combat immoral fantasies, we need to ‘make a cove-

nant with our eyes,’ as did faithful
Job. (Job 31:1, 7, 9) We must solemnly decide to control our eyes and
not allow them to gaze with immoral lust at another person. That
would include averting our gaze
from sexually charged images, be
they on a computer screen, a billboard, a magazine cover, or anywhere else. In your ?ght against
wrong desires, take immediate action. Willingly submit to the counsel of God’s Word, which can help
you avoid wrongdoing and thus remain chaste.—Jas. 1:21-25. w15 6/15
3:12-14

Friday, July 14
Do not bring us into temptation.
—Matt. 6:13.
Considering what happened to
Jesus shortly after his baptism can
help us to understand the need for
the request: “Do not bring us
into temptation.” Jesus was led into
the wilderness by God’s spirit.
Why? “To be tempted by the
Devil.” (Matt. 4:1) Should that surprise us? Not if we grasp the main
reason why God sent his Son to the
earth. That was to settle the issue
raised when Adam and Eve rejected
God’s sovereignty. Questions needed time to be settled. For example,
was something wrong with the way
God created man? Was it possible
for a perfect human to uphold God’s
sovereignty regardless of pressures
from “the wicked one”? And would
mankind be better o? independent
of God’s rulership, as Satan implied? (Gen. 3:4, 5) Answering such
questions would require time but
would show all intelligent creation
that Jehovah exercises his sovereignty in a bene?cial way. w15 6/15

Saturday, July 15
Then there will be great tribulation.—Matt. 24:21.
How will the great tribulation begin? The book of Revelation answers by describing the destruction
of “Babylon the Great.” (Rev. 17:5-7)
How appropriate that all false religion is likened to a prostitute! The
clergy have prostituted themselves
with the leaders of this wicked
world. Instead of loyally supporting
Jesus and his Kingdom, they have
given their support to human rulers and have compromised godly
principles just to gain political in?uence. They stand in stark contrast
with the clean, virginlike anointed
ones of God. (2 Cor. 11:2; Jas. 1:27;
Rev. 14:4) But who will destroy the
harlotlike organization? Jehovah
God will put “his thought” into the
hearts of “the ten horns” of the
“scarlet-colored wild beast.” These
horns represent all the present political powers that give support
to the United Nations, an organization pictured by the “scarletcolored wild beast.”—Rev. 17:3, 1618. w15 7/15 2:3, 4

Sunday, July 16
Each one of you says: “I belong to
Paul,” “But I to Apollos,” “But I to
Cephas,” “But I to Christ.”
—1 Cor. 1:12.
What was the solution to such disruptive thinking? Paul exhorted the
Christians: “I urge you, brothers, . . . that you should all speak
in agreement and that there should
be no divisions among you, but
that you may be completely united in the same mind and in the same
line of thought.” (1 Cor. 1:10, 11, 13)

Neither should there be divisions
of any kind in the Christian congregation today. (Rom. 16:17, 18) Paul
urged anointed Christians to focus
on their heavenly citizenship rather than on earthly things. (Phil. 3:
17-20) They were to act as ambassadors substituting for Christ. Ambassadors do not meddle in the affairs of the nations to which they
are assigned. Their loyalties lie elsewhere. (2 Cor. 5:20) Christians with
an earthly hope are also subjects
of God’s Kingdom, so it is inappropriate for them to take sides in this
world’s disputes. w15 7/15 3:9, 10

Monday, July 17
He was merciful; he would forgive
their error and not bring them to
ruin. He often held back his anger
instead of stirring up all his wrath.
—Ps. 78:38.
Re?ecting on that verse may help
you to appreciate in a very personal way that Jehovah loves and
cares for you. Be assured that you
do matter to Jehovah. (1 Pet. 5:6, 7)
We should value the Bible highly because God communicates with us
primarily by means of it. Meaningful and compassionate communication between parents and their
children is essential to building mutual trust and developing a feeling
of being loved. What can we expect
of Jehovah? Although we have never seen him or heard his voice, he
“speaks” to us through his inspired
Word, and we need to listen. (Isa.
30:20, 21) Jehovah desires to guide
us, his dedicated people, and to protect us from harm. He also wants us
to know him and to put our trust in
him.—Ps. 19:7-11; Prov. 1:33. w15 8/15

Draw close to God, and he will
draw close to you.—Jas. 4:8.
As much as we look forward
to the Paradise ahead, the primary
blessings in the new world will be
spiritual. How deeply satisfying it
will be to know that Jehovah’s
name has been sancti?ed and his
sovereignty vindicated! (Matt. 6:9,
10) We will be thrilled to see Jehovah’s original purpose for mankind
and the earth being ful?lled. And
just think how much easier it
will be to draw closer to Jehovah as
we approach, and ?nally reach, perfection! (Ps. 73:28) These blessings
can be ours, for Jesus assures us
that “with God all things are possible.” (Matt. 19:25, 26) But if we expect to live in that new world—and
to keep living beyond Christ’s Thousand Year Reign—we must act now
to “get a ?rm hold” on everlasting
life. (1 Tim. 6:19) We must live in expectation of the end of this wicked
world, and we need to take positive
steps right now to prepare for life in
the new world. w15 8/15 3:2, 3

Wednesday, July 19
This means everlasting life, their
coming to know you, the only true
God, and the one whom you sent,
Jesus Christ.—John 17:3.
Much of what is produced by this
world’s media can be spiritually
dangerous to Christians. Such material is not designed to build faith
in Jehovah and his promises. Instead, it re?ects Satan’s evil world
and its goals. Therefore, we need
to exercise great caution so that we
do not choose material that could
arouse “worldly desires.” (Titus 2:

12) In contrast with what the world
produces, the material produced by
Jehovah’s organization in these last
days encourages conduct that leads
to eternal life. How blessed we are
to have magazines, brochures,
books, videos, and Web pages that
promote true worship! God’s organization also provides regular meetings in more than 110,000 congregations worldwide. At those meetings
and at assemblies and conventions,
we consider Bible-based material
that builds faith in God and his
promises.—Heb. 10:24, 25. w15 8/15 4:

Thursday, July 20
Their conscience is bearing witness
with them.—Rom. 2:15.
Servants of Jehovah want to train
their conscience. They want the
proddings of their conscience to
agree with the standards of right
and wrong, good and bad, as re?ected in God’s Word. A properly trained
conscience exercises a powerful in?uence for good in the Christian
congregation. However, training
and using our Christian conscience
is not just a mental activity. The Bible links a good conscience to faith
and love. Paul wrote: “The objective
of this instruction is love out of a
clean heart and out of a good conscience and out of faith without hypocrisy.” (1 Tim. 1:5) As we train our
conscience and respond to it, our
love for Jehovah will deepen and our
faith will be strengthened. In fact,
the way we use our conscience reveals the depth of our spirituality,
the quality of our heart, and the intensity of our desire to please Jehovah. Indeed, this inner voice re?ects
what sort of person we truly are.
w15 9/15 2:2, 3

Friday, July 21
See what sort of love the Father
has given us!—1 John 3:1.
Jehovah is the Creator of all humans. (Ps. 100:3-5) That is why
the Bible calls Adam a “son of
God,” and Jesus taught his followers to address God as “our
Father in the heavens.” (Luke 3:38;
Matt. 6:9) Being the Life-Giver, Jehovah is our Father; the relationship between him and us is that of
a father to his children. Simply put,
Jehovah loves us the way a devoted
father loves his children. Human fathers, of course, are imperfect. Try
as they may, they do not fully re?ect
the way Jehovah expresses his fatherly love. In fact, some individuals have dark memories of growing
up in family situations that have left
them with deep emotional or psychological scars. That is painful and
sad, even tragic. To be sure, Jehovah is not a father like that. (Ps. 27:
10) Knowing how Jehovah loves and
cares for us will surely draw us closer to him.—Jas. 4:8. w15 9/15 4:3, 4

Saturday, July 22
God is the one who for the sake of
his good pleasure energizes you,
giving you both the desire and the
power to act.—Phil. 2:13.
It would re?ect a serious lack of
love and trust for us to make decisions without taking God’s will into
consideration. Once in the days of
Samuel, Israel was badly defeated
in battle by the Philistines. God’s
people were in dire need of help and
protection. What did they do? “Let
us take the ark of Jehovah’s covenant with us from Shiloh, so that

it may be with us and save us from
the hand of our enemies,” they decided. The outcome? “The slaughter
was very great; on Israel’s side, 30,000 foot soldiers fell. Moreover, the
Ark of God was captured.” (1 Sam.
4:2-4, 10, 11) It might have seemed
that in taking the Ark with them,
the Israelites were looking to Jehovah for help. Really, though, they
had not sought Jehovah’s direction;
they were following their own ideas,
and the result was disastrous.
—Prov. 14:12. w15 9/15 5:16, 17

Sunday, July 23
Give us more faith.
—Luke 17:5.
What can you do to build and
maintain strong faith? Do not be
satis?ed with only what you learned
up to the point of your baptism.
(Heb. 6:1, 2) Take note of ful?lled
prophecies in the Bible because
these can provide you with powerful reasons for having faith. You can
also use God’s Word as a measuring
rod to see if your faith matches the
description of what is expected of
those who have strong faith. (Jas.
1:25; 2:24, 26) The apostle Paul told
fellow Christians that they could
“have an interchange of encouragement by one another’s faith.” (Rom.
1:12) As we associate with fellow
worshippers, we can build up
one another’s faith, especially when
we are with those who have already
demonstrated the “tested quality”
of their faith. (Jas. 1:3) Bad associations destroy faith, but good associations build it. (1 Cor. 15:33) That
is one reason why we are counseled
not to forsake “our meeting together.”—Heb. 10:24, 25. w15 10/15 2:2, 8, 9

Monday, July 24
Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them.—1 Tim. 4:15.
We need time to meditate as we
prepare to conduct a Bible study.
With each student in mind, we
might think of a viewpoint question
or an illustration to help the student
make progress. Time spent in this
way can be most refreshing, as pondering over these things strengthens our own faith and helps us to
conduct our Bible studies with
greater e?ectiveness and enthusiasm. The same is true when we prepare our heart to go out in the ?eld
service. (Ezra 7:10) Reading a chapter from the Bible book of Acts will
“stir up like a ?re” our enthusiasm
for the ministry. Meditating on Bible
verses we intend to use that day and
the publications we plan to o?er
will help us carry out our privilege
of service. (2 Tim. 1:6) Think about
the people in the territory and what
may arouse their interest. All such
preparation will move us to witness
e?ectively “with a demonstration of
spirit and power” from the Word of
God.—1 Cor. 2:4. w15 10/15 4:9

Tuesday, July 25
If . . . your right eye is making you
stumble, tear it out.—Matt. 5:29.
Ask yourself: ‘What may tempt my
child to look at pornography? Does
he know why it is so dangerous? Am
I approachable so that he will come
to me for help if he is ever tempted
to look at pornography?’ Even while
your children are quite young, you
could say to them: “If you ever come
across an immoral website and
you feel tempted to look at it, please
come and talk to me. You don’t have

to be ashamed. I want to help you.”
Insight will also help you to choose
your own entertainment prudently.
“What we as parents approve of in
the way of music, movies, or books
sets the tone for the family,” says
a father named Pranas. “You can
say a lot about a lot of things, but
your children will watch what you
do and imitate you.” If your children
see you carefully choosing clean entertainment, they will probably be
moved to make similar choices.
—Rom. 2:21-24. w15 11/15 1:12-14

Wednesday, July 26
I will give you insight and instruct
you in the way you should go.
—Ps. 32:8.
Increased emphasis is now being
placed on public witnessing: at bus
stops, train stations, parking lots,
in public squares, and markets. If
engaging in some of these features
of service makes you nervous, why
not give prayerful thought to
this comment of longtime traveling
overseer Angelo Manera, Jr.: “We
looked at each new feature of service as another way to serve Jehovah, as another way to prove our
loyalty to him, as another test of
our integrity, and we were eager to
prove ourselves willing to serve him
in any way he asked.” Engaging in
a new feature of the work, perhaps
one outside our comfort zone, helps
us to build trust and faith in Jehovah, leading to greater spirituality. (2 Cor. 12:9, 10) Many publishers have enjoyed directing people
to our website, jw.org. It is reaching
people with the good news, even in
remote areas. w15 11/15 5:12, 13, 15

As iron sharpens iron, so one man
sharpens his friend.—Prov. 27:17.
In the past, the English New World
Translation followed the pattern of
some other English Bibles that
use the Hebrew expression “Sheol” in verses such as Ecclesiastes 9:
10. That verse used to read: “There
is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in She1ol, the place
to which you are going.” Translators
of many non-English editions faced
this problem: The term “Sheol” is
unknown to most of their readers,
it is not found in their dictionaries,
and it sounds like some geographic location. Accordingly, for the
2013 revision, approval was given
to make the meaning of “Sheol” and
the corresponding Greek term “Hades” clear by translating them accurately as “the Grave.” Obsolete
English expressions were also replaced, and a concerted e?ort was
put forth to make the text clear and
easy to understand without sacri?cing accuracy. Applying what
had been done in other languages sharpened the English text.

Happy is anyone who shows consideration to the lowly one; Jehovah will rescue him in the day of
calamity. Jehovah will guard him
and keep him alive.—Ps. 41:1, 2.
If we are ill, we can look to God
for comfort, wisdom, and support, as did true worshippers in
the past. Still, we know that an individual living in David’s day who
showed consideration to a lowly one did not keep living without end. Hence, when David wrote
the above, he could not have meant

that such a considerate individual would be kept alive miraculously, thus gaining everlasting life. We
can take those inspired words to
mean that God would help the loyal considerate one. How? David explained: “Jehovah will sustain him
on his sickbed; during his sickness
you will completely change his bed.”
(Ps. 41:3) Yes, an individual who
showed consideration to a lowly one
could be certain that God was aware
of him and his faithful course. And
the recuperative power of his Godgiven body might help him to get better, to recover from his sickness.

Keep in mind those in prison.
—Heb. 13:3.
Paul was not here referring to
just any type of prisoner. He was
speaking about those brothers who
were imprisoned for their faith. Paul
himself had been in prison bonds
for some four years by the time
he penned those words to the Hebrew Christians. (Phil. 1:12-14) He
commended the brothers for having
“expressed sympathy for those in
prison.” (Heb. 10:34) Those Hebrew
Christians were physically separated from Paul. So how could they
keep him in mind? They could do
so by their fervent prayers in his
behalf. (Heb. 13:18, 19) Today, we
may likewise be separated physically from our brothers who have been
thrown into prison. We may not be
able to give them the practical help
that is provided by the Witnesses
who live near the prison. But we can
show our sympathy and brotherly affection by constantly remembering
these faithful ones and mentioning
them in our prayers, pleading to Jehovah in their behalf. w16.01 1:13, 14

The spirit itself bears witness with
our spirit that we are God’s
children.—Rom. 8:16.

Mind your own business.
—1 Thess. 4:11.

God’s original purpose was for
mankind to live forever here on
earth. (Gen. 1:28; Ps. 37:29) The selection of some to go to heaven to
rule as kings and priests is not the
norm. It is an exceptional arrangement. This calling causes a
profound change in the thinking, outlook, and hope of a person
when he is anointed. (Eph. 1:18) But
how does a person know that he has
the heavenly calling, that he has,
in fact, received this special token?
The answer is clearly seen in Paul’s
words to the anointed brothers in
Rome, who were “called to be holy
ones.” He told them: “You did not
receive a spirit of slavery causing
fear again, but you received a spirit
of adoption as sons, by which spirit we cry out: ‘Abba, Father!’ ” (Rom.
1:7; 8:15) Simply put, by means of
his holy spirit, God makes it clear to
that person that he is invited to become a future heir in the Kingdom
arrangement.—1 Thess. 2:12. w16.01
3:8, 9

Tuesday, August 1
Will the Judge of all the earth not
do what is right?—Gen. 18:25.
Because he made it a practice
to obey Jehovah even in seemingly minor matters, Abraham kept
his friendship with God healthy and
?ourishing. He felt free to open his
heart to Jehovah, asking for help
as he struggled with hard questions. For example, when he learned
that God was going to destroy
the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham was concerned that
righteous people might be swept

How can we show appropriate respect for those whom Jehovah
chooses to anoint? We would not
ask them personal questions about
their anointing. We thus avoid meddling with what does not concern
us. (2 Thess. 3:11) We should not assume that the parents, spouse, or
other relatives of one of the anointed would also be anointed. Genetics
or marriage play no part in the process. (1 Thess. 2:12) We should also
resist the urge to quiz spouses of
anointed ones about how they feel
knowing that they will live without
their mate in the future earthly Paradise. Rather than raise questions
that may cause pain, all of us can
have full con?dence that Jehovah
will open his hand and “satisfy the
desire of every living thing.” (Ps.
145:16) Those who treat anointed
Christians in a proper manner protect themselves from an insidious
danger—“false brothers” who claim
to be anointed.—Gal. 2:4, 5; 1 John
2:19. w16.01 4:10, 11
away along with the wicked. Perhaps Abraham was worried about
his nephew Lot and his family, who
were then living in Sodom. Abraham
asked his questions with great humility and trust in God, “the Judge
of all the earth.” Jehovah patiently
taught Abraham how merciful He
is, reading every heart and looking
for righteous ones to preserve, even
in times of judgment. (Gen. 18:2233) No doubt, every bit of knowledge and experience helped Abraham maintain his close friendship
with Jehovah. w16.02 1:11, 12

May Jehovah be between you and
me and between your o?spring and
my o?spring forever.
—1 Sam. 20:42.
Loyalty is almost universally admired. However, we would miss a vital lesson if we were to admire
Jonathan’s loyalty to David without
taking into account his loyalty to
God. Why did Jonathan view David
as a friend rather than a rival? Loyalty to God had ?rst place in
Jonathan’s heart. Indeed, loyalty to
Jehovah was the very basis for his
loyalty to David. And both men loyally lived up to their sworn oath. As
Christians, we do not merely admire
loyalty in others; we ourselves are
loyal to family members, friends,
and fellow worshippers. (1 Thess. 2:
10, 11) But what loyalty should take
?rst place in our heart? Why, it is
loyalty to the One who gave us life!
(Rev. 4:11) Maintaining that loyalty gives us true joy and satisfaction.
But if we are to prove loyal to God,
we must stick to him even through
di?cult trials. w16.02 3:3, 4

Thursday, August 3
Daniel resolved in his heart that he
would not de?le himself.—Dan. 1:8.
A mature young person is stable
in his convictions. He does not
act like a friend of God at the Kingdom Hall but a friend of the world at
school. He remains unmovable even
during tests of faith. (Eph. 4:14, 15)
Of course, no one is perfect;
young people as well as adults make
mistakes from time to time. (Eccl.
7:20) Still, as you are considering
baptism, it would be wise to analyze to what extent you are resolved

in your heart to stick to Jehovah’s
standards. Ask yourself, ‘What is
my track record of adhering to
God’s standards?’ Give thought to
the way you have reacted to recent
tests of faith. Have you demonstrated that you have the discernment
needed to distinguish right from
wrong? What if, like Daniel, you are
treated as special by someone in Satan’s world? Are you able to “keep
perceiving what the will of Jehovah
is” even when God’s will con?icts
with what you are tempted to do?
—Eph. 5:17. w16.03 1:7-9

Friday, August 4
Those days will be days of a tribulation such as has not occurred
from the beginning of the creation
that God created until that time.
—Mark 13:19.
We are living in what the Bible
calls “the last days,” and straight
ahead is a tribulation like nothing
that has occurred before. (2 Tim.
3:1) Furthermore, Satan and his demons have been cast out of heaven
and are con?ned to the vicinity of
the earth, resulting in intense woe
for earth’s inhabitants. (Rev. 12:9,
12) We have been commissioned to
carry out a historic and unprecedented preaching campaign that is
reaching peoples and language
groups as never before! To keep receiving God’s blessing, we need to
pay attention to all the directions
provided through the Christian congregation. Having an obedient spirit now will help us to follow directions during the “great tribulation,”
which will eliminate Satan’s entire
evil system. (Matt. 24:21) Thereafter, we will need new directions
for new world living. w16.03 4:16, 18

Saturday, August 5
Locusts came out of the smoke.
—Rev. 9:3.
Toward the end of the ?rst century C.E., the apostle John received a
vision of seven angels, each of whom
sounded a trumpet blast. When the
?fth angel blew his trumpet, John
saw “a star” fall from heaven to
earth. The “star” had a key in his
hand with which he opened the shaft
of an abyss. Thick smoke poured
out, and from this came a plague of
locusts. Rather than ravage vegetation, the symbolic locusts swarm
against “those people who do not
have the seal of God on their foreheads.” (Rev. 9:1-4) John no doubt
knew how devastating a locust
swarm could be. Had not locusts
plagued ancient Egypt in Moses’
day? (Ex. 10:12-15) The ?gurative locusts that John saw well illustrate
anointed Christians proclaiming Jehovah’s powerful judgment messages. They are joined now by millions of companions with an earthly
hope. Little wonder that our united preaching undermines the authority Satan exercises through his
worldwide empire of false religion!
w16.03 3:3

Sunday, August 6
Open my eyes so that I may see
clearly the wonderful things from
your law.—Ps. 119:18.
To determine to what extent a less
experienced brother’s thoughts and
actions are in?uenced by Kingdom
truth, an elder might ask him, ‘How
has your dedication to Jehovah
changed the way you use your life?’
That question can lead to a meaningful conversation about what makes
our sacred service whole-souled.
(Mark 12:29, 30) Perhaps at the end
of such a conversation, he might say

a prayer, asking Jehovah to give the
brother the holy spirit he needs to
complete his training. How upbuilding it will be for the brother to hear
the elder’s heartfelt prayer in his behalf! In the initial phase of training,
an elder could consider some Bible
accounts that might help the learner to see the need to be willing, reliable, and humble. (1 Ki. 19:19-21; Neh.
7:2; 13:13; Acts 18:24-26) Such qualities are as essential to the learner as
nutrients are to the soil. They quicken his spiritual growth and serve to
‘open his eyes’ to “the wonderful
things” in God’s Word. w15 4/15 2:3, 4

Monday, August 7
Draw close to God.
—Jas. 4:8.
Having regular communication
with Jehovah is a vital part of
drawing close to him. How can you
communicate with God? You talk
to Jehovah by means of your frequent prayers to him. (Ps. 142:2) And
you allow Jehovah to talk to you,
as it were, when you regularly read
his written Word and meditate on it.
(Isa. 30:20, 21) When you are specific in your prayers, you become more
keenly aware of Jehovah’s answers,
even though they may be subtle. Answered prayers will make Jehovah
more real to you. In addition, the
more you express your innermost
concerns to Jehovah, the closer he
will draw to you. Developing a closer relationship with Jehovah is a
lifetime pursuit. We must take steps
to draw close to God if we want him
to take corresponding action toward
us. By all means, then, let us remain
in regular communication with our
God by means of Bible study and
prayer. As a result, our ever-growing
relationship with Jehovah will enable us to meet our trials successfully. w15 4/15 3:3, 14, 16

Tuesday, August 8
Your adversary, the Devil, walks
about like a roaring lion, seeking
to devour someone.—1 Pet. 5:8.
How well this text describes Satan’s vicious disposition! Although the whole world already
lies in his power, Satan is hungry for more victims. Satan is intent on devouring Jehovah’s people. The waves of persecution he
has unleashed against Jesus’ followers from the ?rst century until now
give evidence of his vicious spirit. A famished lion feels no pity for
its prey. It feels no compassion before the kill and experiences no remorse afterward. In a similar way,
Satan has shown no pity for those
whom he tries to devour. For example, think about how often Satan
the Devil must have been lurking
somewhere when the Israelites succumbed to such sins as sexual immorality and greed. When you read
about the tragic consequences that
befell immoral Zimri and greedy Gehazi, for instance, can you “see” the
roaring lion reveling in his conquest?—Num. 25:6-8, 14, 15; 2 Ki. 5:
20-27. w15 5/15 1:8, 9

Wednesday, August 9
Oppose the Devil, and he will ?ee
from you.—Jas. 4:7.
How can we ?ght Satan and win?
Jesus told his disciples: “By your
endurance you will preserve your
lives.” (Luke 21:19) Nothing that any
human can do will cause us permanent harm. Nobody can take away
our precious friendship with God
unless we allow that to happen.
(Rom. 8:38, 39) Even the death of Jehovah’s servants does not score a

victory for Satan, for Jehovah will
see to it that they are resurrected!
(John 5:28, 29) On the other hand,
Satan’s prospects are bleak indeed.
After the destruction of his ungodly system, Satan will be abyssed for
1,000 years. (Rev. 20:1-3) At the end
of Jesus’ Thousand Year Reign, Satan will be “released from his prison” for a short time to make a ?nal
attempt to mislead perfect mankind. After that, the Devil will be destroyed. (Rev. 20:7-10) Satan faces
certain doom, but that is not true of
you! Take your stand against Satan,
?rm in the faith. (1 Pet. 5:9) You can
?ght Satan and win! w15 5/15 2:1, 18

Thursday, August 10
The shrewd one sees the danger and
conceals himself, but the inexperienced keep right on going and su?er
the consequences.—Prov. 22:3.
A shrewd person realizes that
contemplation can be like a ?re. If
?re is handled properly, it can be
useful, such as when it cooks
our food. But ?re is deadly when it
is uncontrolled and burns down a
house and kills its occupants. Similarly, contemplation is useful when
it helps us to imitate Jehovah. However, it can be harmful when it feeds
immoral desires. For example, if we
make it a practice to think about
sinful actions, this could lead to our
acting out such fantasies. Indeed,
indulging in immoral reverie can
be spiritually deadly! (Jas. 1:14, 15)
Jesus warned against entertaining
mental images of immoral conduct.
He said: “Everyone who keeps on
looking at a woman so as to have a
passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.”
—Matt. 5:28. w15 5/15 4:11, 12, 14

I was especially fond of the sons of
men.—Prov. 8:31.
Woven throughout the fabric of
Jesus’ preaching tours were evidences of his genuine concern for
the human family. In one instance,
Jesus encountered a pitiful sight.
(Mark 1:39, 40) Right in front of him
was a man with a frightful disease,
leprosy. Testifying to the advanced
stage of the man’s illness, physician
Luke describes him as being
“full of leprosy.” (Luke 5:12) “When
he caught sight of Jesus, [the leper] fell facedown and begged
him: ‘Lord, if you just want to,
you can make me clean.’ ” The man
had no doubt that Jesus possessed
the power to heal him, but what he
needed to know was, did Jesus have
the desire to do so? How would Jesus respond to this heartfelt request? Jesus stretched out his
hand, touched the leper, and with a
voice re?ecting both strength and
tenderness, he said: “I want to! Be
made clean.” Then “the leprosy vanished from him.” (Luke 5:13) Yes,
Jesus demonstrated how much he
loved people.—Luke 5:17. w15 6/15
2:3-5

Saturday, August 12
Whoever isolates himself . . .
rejects all practical wisdom.
—Prov. 18:1.
Courageously placing ourselves
under the kindly scrutiny of a mature Christian may prevent us
from rationalizing any wrong desires. (Heb. 3:12, 13) Talking about
our weakness with a mature, spiritually quali?ed Christian may help
us to identify blind spots. This can
help us to make the necessary adjustments in order to remain in Je-

hovah’s love. Christian elders are
especially quali?ed to help us. (Jas.
5:13-15) Seeking assistance is essential if the source of any immoral desires is the unclean habit of viewing
pornography. The longer the delay
in seeking help, the greater the risk
that unclean desires will ‘become
fertile and give birth to sin’ that will
hurt others and bring reproach on
Jehovah’s name. The desire to
please Jehovah and to remain in the
Christian congregation has moved
many of his servants to accept loving help.—Jas. 1:15; Ps. 141:5; Heb.
12:5, 6. w15 6/15 3:15-17

Sunday, August 13
In that day each of the prophets
will be ashamed of his vision when
he prophesies; and they will not
wear an o?cial garment of hair in
order to deceive.—Zech. 13:4.
Will the destruction of the religions of Babylon the Great result in
the death of all the former members
of those religions? Apparently not.
Some of the clergy will abandon
their religious course and deny that
they were ever part of those false
religions. (Zech. 13:5, 6) How will
God’s people fare at that time? Jesus explains: “In fact, unless those
days were cut short, no ?esh would
be saved; but on account of the chosen ones those days will be cut short.”
(Matt. 24:22) In 66 C.E., the tribulation was “cut short.” This allowed
“the chosen ones,” anointed Christians, to ?ee the city and its environs. Likewise, the initial part of
the future great tribulation will be
“cut short” because of “the chosen
ones.” The political “ten horns” will
not be allowed to annihilate God’s
people. (Rev. 17:16) Rather, there
will be a brief respite. w15 7/15 2:5, 6

Monday, August 14
The Tempter approached.
—Matt. 4:3.
It is up to each individual whether
he will allow himself to be brought
into temptation or not. (Matt. 6:13;
Jas. 1:13-15) For his part, Jesus immediately rejected each temptation
from the Devil by the use of a relevant quotation from God’s Word.
Thus, Jesus upheld God’s rightful
sovereignty. But Satan did not give
up. He waited “until another
convenient time.” (Luke 4:13) Jesus continued to resist all of Satan’s
e?orts to break his integrity.
However, Satan attempts to ensnare Jesus’ followers, including
you. Because of the ongoing issue
regarding God’s sovereignty, Jehovah allows the Tempter to use this
world to tempt us. God is not bringing us into temptation. On the contrary, he has con?dence in us
and he wants to help us. Out of respect for our free will, though, Jehovah does not automatically
prevent us from falling into temptation. We have to do two things—remain spiritually awake and persist
in prayer. w15 6/15 5:13, 14

Tuesday, August 15
In no way are we giving any cause
for stumbling, so that no fault may
be found with our ministry.
—2 Cor. 6:3.
Christians have to train their
mind and conscience to respond appropriately when neutrality-related
issues arise. (Rom. 14:19) Take,
for example, Mirjeta from a region
of the former Yugoslavia. She was
raised to hate Serbians. On learning
that Jehovah is impartial and that
Satan is responsible for inciting
ethnic problems, she strove to rid

herself of nationalistic sentiments.
Yet, when ethnic violence broke out
in her area, old hatreds began to resurface in her, causing Mirjeta to
?nd it di?cult to preach to Serbs.
She realized, though, that she could
not just sit back and hope that such
unwholesome feelings would go
away. She begged Jehovah for help
to overcome this challenge. “I have
found that focusing on the ministry
is the best help ever,” she says. “In
the ministry, I try to imitate Jehovah’s loving personality, and I
have seen my negative feelings melt
away.” w15 7/15 3:11-13

Wednesday, August 16
The eyes of Jehovah are roving
about through all the earth to show
his strength in behalf of those whose
heart is complete toward him.
—2 Chron. 16:9.
Note the case of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. On one occasion, Jehoshaphat unwisely agreed to accompany King Ahab of Israel in
a military venture. Although 400
false prophets assured wicked Ahab
of success, Jehovah’s true prophet Micaiah foretold certain defeat. Ahab died in battle, and Jehoshaphat barely escaped with his
life. Upon returning to Jerusalem,
he was reproved for allying himself
with Ahab. Even so, Jehu, the son of
Hanani the visionary, told Jehoshaphat: “There are good things that
have been found in you.” (2 Chron.
18:4, 5, 18-22, 33, 34; 19:1-3) Yes, Jehoshaphat committed a foolish act,
but Jehovah was not blind to the
good things he had done. (2 Chron.
17:3-10) This Bible account provides
a reminder that despite our human
imperfection, Jehovah will have enduring love for us if we wholeheartedly seek to please him. w15 8/15
1:8, 9

Thursday, August 17
Tell them to work at good, . . . so
that they may get a ?rm hold on
the real life.—1 Tim. 6:18, 19.
How might we prepare now
for life in God’s new world? Well,
suppose we were planning to move
to another country. How could we
prepare for that change? We might
start learning the language of
the people who live there. Learning about their customs would be
bene?cial. We might sample some of
their foods. To a certain extent, we
would begin to live as if we were already residents of that land. After
all, that is the way we expect to live
once we arrive there. Similarly, we
can prepare for life in the new world
by living now, to the extent possible, as we expect to live then. Independence and an unreasonable
insistence on personal preference
may be highly regarded by some,
but what has been the result? Failure to accept God’s direction has
led to su?ering, misery, even tragedy. (Jer. 10:23) How we look forward to the time when all mankind
will submit to Jehovah’s loving sovereignty! w15 8/15 3:4, 5

Friday, August 18
Do not become unevenly yoked
with unbelievers.—2 Cor. 6:14.
Watching their associations is
particularly important for single
Christians who want to get married.
The Bible counsels God’s servants
who are seeking a marriage mate
to marry “only in the Lord,” that is,
to marry only a dedicated, baptized
worshipper of Jehovah who lives
according to Scriptural teachings.
(1 Cor. 7:39) By marrying fellow believers, Christians gain companions
who are dedicated to Jehovah and

will help them maintain their integrity to him. Jehovah knows what
is best for his servants, and he has
been consistent in stating his viewpoint regarding marriage. Note his
easily understood command to Israel through Moses. With reference
to the inhabitants of surrounding
nations—people who did not serve
Jehovah—the Israelites were instructed: “You must not form any
marriage alliances with them. . . .
For they will turn your sons away
from following me to serve other
gods.”—Deut. 7:3, 4. w15 8/15 4:12, 13

Saturday, August 19
Make sure of the more important
things, so that you may be ?awless
and not stumbling others.
—Phil. 1:10.
How can we train our conscience?
Key ways are by regularly and
prayerfully studying the Bible, meditating on what we read, and then
putting into practice what we have
learned. Obviously, this involves
more than accumulating facts and
learning rules. Our study of the Bible should gradually give us an ever
more precise picture of Jehovah, his personality, his qualities,
and what he likes or dislikes. Our
conscience becomes attuned to the
ways of Jehovah God. This should
stir our heart, moving us to want
to become more and more like him.
However, if we cannot understand
the conscientious decision of a fellow believer on some personal matter, we should not quickly judge him
or feel that we ought to pressure
him to change his mind. Perhaps
his conscience is still “weak” and in
need of more training or is too sensitive on certain issues.—1 Cor. 8:11,
12. w15 9/15 2:4, 8, 10

Sunday, August 20
The earth he has given to the sons
of men.—Ps. 115:16.
The earth appears to be unique
among all of God’s creation. Just
imagine, out of the unknown number of planets that exist in the Milky
Way and beyond, Jehovah created
the earth to be not merely a habitable place but a comfortable, beautiful, and safe home for his human
creation! (Isa. 45:18) This re?ects
how Jehovah must love us. (Job 38:
4, 7; Ps. 8:3-5) Though Jehovah
created a wonderful home for us, he
knows that for us to be happy and
content, we need more than material provisions. A child feels truly secure when he senses his parents’
love and attention. Jehovah created humans in his image, giving
them the spiritual capacity to sense
and to respond to his love and care.
(Gen. 1:27) Furthermore, Jesus
said: “Happy are those conscious
of their spiritual need.” (Matt. 5:3)
As a loving Father, Jehovah “richly provides us with all the things we
enjoy,” both physically and spiritually.—1 Tim. 6:17; Ps. 145:16. w15 9/15
4:6, 7

Monday, August 21
There is a way that seems right to
a man, but in the end it leads to
death.—Prov. 14:12.
The psalmist showed the right
heart attitude when he wrote: “Wait
for God, for I will yet praise him as
my Grand Savior. My God, I am
in despair. That is why I remember
you.” (Ps. 42:5, 6) What deep feeling
and love for Jehovah! Have you developed such love for and reliance
on our heavenly Father? Even if you

are inclined to answer yes, you may
be able to increase your reliance
on him in line with what the Bible
tells us: “Trust in Jehovah with all
your heart, and do not rely on
your own understanding. In all your
ways take notice of him, and he will
make your paths straight.” (Prov. 3:
5, 6) By loving us ?rst, Jehovah has
shown us how to love him. (1 John
4:19) Let us always keep in mind his
surpassing example. And let us increasingly demonstrate our love for
him ‘with our whole heart and with
our whole soul and with our whole
mind and with our whole strength.’
—Mark 12:30. w15 9/15 5:17-19

Tuesday, August 22
As for me and my household, we
will serve Jehovah.—Josh. 24:15.
When we share in the ?eld ministry, not only do we build faith in others but our own faith grows. Like
the early Christians, we learn to
put full faith in Jehovah and speak
boldly in any situation. (Acts 4:1720; 13:46) As we sense how Jehovah
helps us in life and how he answers
our prayers, our faith grows. This
was true of Caleb and Joshua. They
showed faith in Jehovah when they
spied out the Promised Land. However, as they saw Jehovah’s direction at each turn in their life thereafter, their faith grew even more.
No wonder Joshua spoke so strongly to the Israelites, saying: “Not one
word out of all the good promises
that Jehovah your God has spoken
to you has failed.” He later added:
“Therefore, fear Jehovah and serve
him with integrity and faithfulness.”
(Josh. 23:14; 24:14) As we taste Jehovah’s goodness, we too can develop such conviction.—Ps. 34:8.

Ezra had prepared his heart.
—Ezra 7:10.
Do you at times take notes during public talks, assemblies, and
conventions? Reviewing these notes
provides excellent opportunities
for meditation as you think about
what you have learned from
God’s Word and from his organization. Also, each month’s issues of
the Watchtower and Awake! magazines and the latest convention releases give us fresh information
that we can read and digest. When
you read the Yearbook, you may ?nd
it helpful to pause and re?ect on
what you read and let the experiences touch your heart. You may
want to underline key thoughts or
to make notes in the margin, which
you might ?nd helpful when preparing for a return visit, a shepherding
call, or a future talk. Most important, pausing and meditating every
now and then while reading Biblebased publications will give you the
opportunity to absorb the material
and to say a prayer of thanks to Jehovah for the good things you are
learning. w15 10/15 4:9, 10

Jesus went on progressing in wisdom and in physical growth and in
favor with God and men.
—Luke 2:52.
Christian parents have few joys
like that of watching their child get
baptized. “It was a highly emotional experience for us. We were, of
course, grateful that our children
wanted to serve Jehovah,” says Berenice, whose four children were baptized before they turned 14. “But,”

she adds, “we also knew that as teenagers our children would face many
challenges.” One expert on child development states: “Adolescence is
not a period of being ‘crazy’ or ‘immature.’ It is an essential time of
emotional intensity, social engagement, and creativity.” While they
are teenagers, your children can develop a more meaningful friendship
with Jehovah, set and pursue goals
in the ministry, and use more initiative as they make their dedication
and live up to it. They may ?nd adolescence to be a rewarding time of
spiritual growth, even as Jesus did
when he was young. w15 11/15 2:1, 2

Let your Kingdom come. Let your
will take place, as in heaven, also
on earth.—Matt. 6:10.
God’s love for mankind is evident
in the arrangement he has made for
the Messianic Kingdom. Jehovah
has already placed this government
in the hands of his Son, who loves
mankind and is superbly quali?ed to rule. (Prov. 8:31) At their resurrection, Jesus’ 144,000 heavenly
joint heirs take with them the experience of human life. (Rev. 14:1)
The Kingdom was the main theme
of Jesus’ teaching, and he taught
his disciples to pray for it and the
blessings it will bring. Bible prophecy shows that God’s heavenly Kingdom was established when Christ’s
presence began in 1914. Since then,
there has been a gathering of the remaining ones who will rule with Jesus in heaven as well as of “a great
crowd” of people who will survive
this system’s end and be ushered
into the new world.—Rev. 7:9, 13, 14.

Please listen, and I will speak.
—Job 42:4.
The apostle John referred to
God’s ?rst companion as “the Word”
and “the beginning of the creation by God.” (John 1:1; Rev. 3:
14) Jehovah God communicated his
thoughts and feelings to this ?rstborn Son. (John 1:14, 17; Col. 1:
15) The apostle Paul speaks of ‘the
tongues of angels,’ a heavenly form
of communication superior to human language. (1 Cor. 13:1) Jehovah
has intimate knowledge of billions
of intelligent creatures, earthly and
heavenly. At any given moment,
countless individuals may be praying to him in many languages. Not
only does he listen to those prayers
but he simultaneously gives direction to and communicates with heavenly beings. To accomplish this,
his thoughts, language, and communication must be vastly superior to those of humans. (Isa. 55:
8, 9) Clearly, when Jehovah communicates with humans, he simpli?es how he expresses his thoughts
so that man can understand them.
w15 12/15 1:1, 2

The earth will certainly be ?lled
with the knowledge of Jehovah as
the waters cover the sea.
—Isa. 11:9.
In many lands, Bibles are expensive and not readily available, so just
receiving a Bible is a great blessing. A report from Rwanda stated:
“For a long time, many people with
whom the brothers were studying
had not progressed because they
had no Bibles. They could not a?ord
to purchase the local church edi-

tion. And they often could not clearly understand the meaning of certain verses, which hindered their
progress.” Things changed when the
New World Translation in their language became available. A Rwandan
family with four teenagers said: “We
really thank Jehovah and the faithful and discreet slave for giving us
this Bible. We are very poor and had
no money to purchase Bibles for
every member of the family. But now
each of us has his own Bible.To show
our gratitude to Jehovah, we read
the Bible as a family every day.”

O Jehovah, show me favor. Heal
me, for I have sinned against you.
—Ps. 41:4.
David may have written that regarding the time when Absalom
tried to usurp the throne while David was ill and unable to handle the
situation. Despite having received
God’s forgiveness, David did not
forget his own sin with Bath-sheba
and its consequences. (2 Sam. 12:714) Still, the king was sure that God
would sustain him on his sickbed.
David did not pray for God to heal
him miraculously. The context suggests that David asked Jehovah to
help him in the same way that He
would help an individual who
showed consideration to a lowly
one. That included being sustained
“on his sickbed.” (Ps. 41:3) Because
David’s sin had been forgiven, he
could ask that God would comfort
and support him and that the physical resources of his body might enable him to recover. (Ps. 103:3) We
can do likewise. w15 12/15 4:8, 9

Tuesday, August 29
You received a spirit of adoption
as sons, by which spirit we cry out:
“Abba, Father!”—Rom. 8:15.
Those who have received this special invitation from God do not need
another witness from any other
source. They do not need someone
else to verify what has happened
to them. Jehovah leaves no doubt
whatsoever in their minds and
hearts. The apostle John tells such
anointed Christians: “You have an
anointing from the holy one, and all
of you have knowledge.” He further
states: “As for you, the anointing
that you received from him remains
in you, and you do not need anyone
to be teaching you; but the anointing from him is teaching you about
all things and is true and is no lie.
Just as it has taught you, remain in
union with him.” (1 John 2:20, 27)
These ones need spiritual instruction just like everyone else. But they
do not need anyone to validate their
anointing. The most powerful force
in the universe has given them this
conviction! w16.01 3:9, 10

Wednesday, August 30
[Be] content with the present
things.—Heb. 13:5.
True contentment is based on our
trust in Jehovah. It allows us to
have a balanced view of material
possessions. (1 Tim. 6:6-8) It helps
us to realize that our relationship with Jehovah and our Christian brothers is far more important
than anything that money can buy.
A contented person does not complain, grumble, or ?nd fault; nor
does he succumb to feelings of

envy and greed—feelings that can
sti?e the development of brotherly
love. Rather, contentment promotes
a generous spirit. (1 Tim. 6:17-19)
Also, our trust in Jehovah gives us
courage, no matter what challenges
we may face. (Heb. 13:6) This
courage, in turn, allows us to have
a positive attitude and to build up
and comfort our fellow believers.
(1 Thess. 5:14, 15) Even when the
world faces the great tribulation,
we will be able to “stand up straight
and lift up [our] heads,” knowing
that our deliverance is near.—Luke
21:25-28. w16.01 1:16, 17

Thursday, August 31
Jehovah knows those who belong
to him.—2 Tim. 2:19.
In recent years, we have seen an
increase in the number of those partaking at the Memorial of Christ’s
death. That trend contrasts with the
decrease in the number of partakers that we saw for many decades.
Should this increase trouble us? No.
Let us consider some key factors
to keep in mind. Those taking the
count at the Memorial cannot
judge who truly have the heavenly
hope. The number of partakers includes those who mistakenly think
that they are anointed. Some who
at one point started to partake of
the emblems later stopped. Others
may have mental or emotional problems that lead them to believe that
they will rule with Christ in heaven. Therefore, the number of partakers does not accurately indicate
the number of anointed ones left on
earth. And the Bible does not state
how many will be left at the time
that the great tribulation begins.
w16.01 4:12-14

Friday, September 1
[Abraham] traveled to the place
that the true God indicated to him.
—Gen. 22:3.
Before parting from the servants who accompanied Abraham
and Isaac, Abraham said: “You stay
here with the donkey, but the boy
and I will go over there and worship
and return to you.” (Gen. 22:5) What
did Abraham mean? Was he lying to
his servants, telling them that Isaac
would return when Abraham knew
that Isaac was to be sacri?ced? No.
The Bible gives us some insight into
what Abraham was thinking. (Heb.
11:19) Abraham “reasoned that God
was able to raise [Isaac] up even
from the dead.” Yes, Abraham believed in the resurrection. He knew
that Jehovah had revived his reproductive powers and those of Sarah
in their old age. (Heb. 11:11, 12, 18)
Abraham realized that nothing was
impossible for Jehovah. So he was
con?dent that whatever happened
on that challenging day, his beloved
son would be restored to him so
that all of Jehovah’s promises could
be ful?lled. No wonder Abraham is
called “the father of all those having
faith”!—Rom. 4:11. w16.02 1:3, 13

Saturday, September 2
For the sake of his great name,
Jehovah will not abandon his
people.—1 Sam. 12:22.
Although God had anointed Saul
to be king, Saul later became disobedient and was rejected by Jehovah. (1 Sam. 15:17-23) Since God did
not immediately remove Saul from
the throne, his misconduct tested
his subjects and all who were close
to him. They faced the challenge of
being loyal to God while the king,
who sat on “Jehovah’s throne,” fol-

lowed a wayward course. (1 Chron.
29:23) Yet, Saul’s son Jonathan
proved to be loyal to Jehovah. We
too can prove ourselves loyal to Jehovah by being in relative subjection to the superior authorities, as
God requires, even if some seem unworthy of respect. For example, a
government o?cial may be corrupt,
but we still respect his position because we are in relative subjection
to governmental “superior authorities.” (Rom. 13:1, 2) In fact, all of us
can prove loyal to Jehovah by respecting those to whom he gives authority.—1 Cor. 11:3; Heb. 13:17.

Sunday, September 3
Your people will o?er themselves
willingly.—Ps. 110:3.
The Bible says that Jehovah’s
people, including young ones, “will
o?er themselves willingly” for his
service. So a person who is contemplating baptism needs to be sure
that this is his or her personal desire. That might call for self-scrutiny on your part. Why? Because your
circumstance as a youth may be
somewhat special. For example, you
may have been raised in the truth.
Over the years, you have likely seen
many people get baptized—including some of your peers and perhaps
even your siblings. If that is indeed
your situation, what should you be
careful about? Be alert that you do
not come to view baptism as little
more than a coming-of-age custom
that all young people follow sooner or later. What can you do to make
sure that you will keep the right
view of Jehovah’s arrangement of
baptism? Take time often to stop
and think about the reasons why getting baptized is so important.

Let anyone hearing say, “Come!”
and let anyone thirsting come; let
anyone who wishes take life’s
water free.—Rev. 22:17.
As members of the Christian congregation, how can we succeed in
giving this invitation? Only by being “harmoniously joined together
and made to cooperate.” (Eph. 4:16)
To share the message of the Kingdom good news with as many people as possible, we need to carry
out our preaching work in an organized manner. Therefore, we receive directions. The guidance given
through congregations around the
globe prepares us for a united e?ort.
After we meet for ?eld service, we go
forth to proclaim the Kingdom message to mankind. By word of mouth
and through millions of copies of
Bible-based publications, we spread
the message. Do you strive to follow the direction to share in special
preaching campaigns? By doing so,
you are joining millions of others
in unitedly heralding the message
of the “angel ?ying in midheaven,”
mentioned at Revelation 14:6. w16.03

Scrolls were opened.
—Rev. 20:12.
The Bible informs us that scrolls
will be opened to give us directions in new world living. By studying these, all people, including resurrected ones, will be able to know
God’s will for them. These scrolls
will surely give us further insight
into Jehovah’s mind. Guided by an
ever-increasing understanding of
God’s inspired Word along with

what will be revealed in the new
scrolls, inhabitants of the earthly
Paradise will certainly treat their
fellow man with love, respect, and
dignity. (Isa. 26:9) Imagine the educational program that will be carried out under the direction of the
King, Jesus Christ! Everlasting life
awaits those who respond favorably
to the “things written in the scrolls.”
Those who maintain integrity to
God through the ?nal test will have
their name written permanently by
Jehovah in “the scroll of life.” That
can be our lot! w16.03 4:19, 20

You are my hope, O Sovereign
Lord Jehovah; I have trusted in
you since my youth.—Ps. 71:5.
Experienced elders stress the importance of beginning to train
brothers when they are young—in
their early teens—by giving them assignments in the congregation that
?t their age. Such early training will
help young ones to keep their eyes
on spiritual goals when they reach
the late teens and are bombarded
with many distractions. (Ps. 71:17)
An elder will also stimulate a learner’s desire to serve by explaining to
him not only what to do but also why
to do it. By giving reasons, elders
will be imitating the Great Teacher, Jesus. For example, before giving his apostles the commission
to make disciples, Jesus gave them
a reason why they should obey. He
stated: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth.”
Then he added: “Go, therefore, and
make disciples of people of all the
nations.”—Matt. 28:18, 19. w15 4/15

The Lord stood near me and infused power into me, . . . and I
was rescued from the lion’s mouth.
—2 Tim. 4:17.
It was a dangerous time to be a
Christian in Rome. Blamed for setting ?re to the city in 64 C.E.,
Christ’s followers were objects of
intense hostility. It was likely in this
volatile situation that the apostle
Paul was imprisoned in Rome for
the second time. Would other Christians come to his aid? Paul may have
had some initial concerns in that regard, for he wrote to Timothy: “In
my ?rst defense no one came to my
side, but they all forsook me.”
(2 Tim. 4:16) Even so, Paul acknowledged that he had not been entirely without help. He trusted that
Jehovah would fortify him to endure his present trials and any future di?culties that might arise.
In fact, he immediately went on to
say: “The Lord will rescue me
from every wicked work.” (2 Tim. 4:
18) Yes, Paul had learned that even
when human assistance is limited,
the help that Jehovah and his Son
provide is real! w15 4/15 4:1-3

Friday, September 8
He will crush your head.
—Gen. 3:15.
When Jesus was born, Satan
knew that this newborn child would
grow up to become the promised
Messiah. Would Satan reason that
taking the life of a baby was going
too far? Satan has no noble
code of ethics. And with regard to
the child Jesus, Satan did not hesitate to act. How? King Herod was
greatly upset when astrologers inquired about “the one born king of

the Jews,” and he was determined
to kill him. (Matt. 2:1-3, 13) To make
sure that the job was done, he ordered the execution of all boys two
years of age and younger who were
living in Bethlehem and its districts.
(Matt. 2:13-18) Jesus escaped death
in that unimaginable slaughter, but
what does this tell us about our enemy Satan? It is evident that the Devil places no value on human life. He
certainly does not have a soft spot
for children. Satan truly is “a roaring lion.” (1 Pet. 5:8) Never underestimate his vicious disposition!

Saturday, September 9
They did not receive the ful?llment
of the promises; but they saw them
from a distance.—Heb. 11:13.
Our ability to form mental pictures of things we have not seen is
a gift from God. It allows us to make
wise plans and to look forward to
good things. Jehovah can foresee
future events, and in the Scriptures
he often tells us ahead of time what
will happen. We may be able to form
mental pictures of what will occur.
In fact, our ability to conceive of
unseen things helps us to exercise
faith. (2 Cor. 4:18) When Hannah
spent time thinking about what it
would be like when she took her son
Samuel to serve at the tabernacle,
she had a basis for her mental picture. It was based on what she had
resolved to do, and this helped her
to focus on her objective. (1 Sam.
1:22) If we visualize what God has
promised to do, we are thinking
about something that will de?nitely happen. (2 Pet. 1:19-21) No doubt,
many faithful people of Bible times
formed mental pictures of things
God had promised. w15 5/15 3:1-3

Sunday, September 10
The wealth of the rich . . . is like a
protective wall in his imagination.
—Prov. 18:11.
It is a dangerous fantasy to imagine oneself becoming very wealthy
while paying little attention to God.
Jesus related a story to illustrate the sad state of a person “who
stores up treasure for himself but is
not rich toward God.” (Luke
12:16-21) Jehovah rejoices when we
do things that please him. (Prov. 27:
11) How happy we are when we
have his approval because we
have stored up “treasures in heaven”! (Matt. 6:20) And a good relationship with Jehovah is unquestionably the most valuable treasure
we can have. Imagine the extent of
our anxiety if we were consumed by
e?orts to store up “treasures on the
earth.” (Matt. 6:19) Jesus used an illustration to show that “the anxiety
of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches” can choke
the word of the Kingdom.—Matt. 13:
18, 19, 22. w15 5/15 4:15, 16

The crowd felt amazement as they
saw the speechless speaking and
the maimed being made sound and
the lame walking and the blind
seeing.—Matt. 15:31.
God’s power enabled Jesus Christ
to perform a wide variety of astounding miracles. He cured not
only leprosy but also every sort of
disease and every sort of in?rmity
among the people. To perform such
acts of compassion, Jesus needed no organ donors for transplants.
He healed the very organs or
body parts that were a?icted! And

he healed people instantly, sometimes even from a distance. (John
4:46-54) What do these amazing examples show? That Jesus, now enthroned as heavenly King, has not
only the power but also the desire
to bring about permanent healing.
Learning about the way Jesus treated people gives us con?dence that
in the new world, the Bible prophecy will be ful?lled: “He will have
pity on the lowly and the poor.” (Ps.
72:13) Yes, Jesus will then act on his
heart’s desire to help all a?icted
ones. w15 6/15 2:6

Tuesday, September 12
Let your name be sancti?ed.
—Matt. 6:9.
Many people can recite the Lord’s
Prayer from memory. In our doorto-door ministry, we often refer
to this prayer to help householders understand that God’s Kingdom
is a real government that is going
to bring wonderful changes to our
earth. Or we may refer to the ?rst
request in the prayer to show that
God has a personal name, which is
to be sancti?ed, or “treated as
holy.” (Matt. 6:9, ftn.) Did Jesus intend that this prayer be repeated
word for word every time we pray,
as is done by many in Christendom?
No. Just before Jesus provided this
prayer as a pattern, he said: “When
praying, do not say the same things
over and over again.” (Matt. 6:7) On
a later occasion, he restated this
prayer but used di?erent wording.
(Luke 11:1-4) Thus Jesus helped us
know what sort of things we need to
ask for and in what order of importance. Hence, it is ?tting to call it
the model prayer. w15 6/15 4:1, 2

Wednesday, September 13
Let the one who thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall.
—1 Cor. 10:12.
Jehovah gives us his powerful
holy spirit, which can strengthen
us and help us to resist temptation.
God also forewarns us through his
Word and the congregation about
situations that we must avoid, such
as spending excessive time, money, and energy on nonessential material things. Former pioneers Espen and Janne have two children
to care for. “We often pray to Jehovah,” says Espen, “that we may
not fall into temptation now that
we are unable to spend as much
time as we previously did in theocratic activities. We ask Jehovah
to help us maintain our spirituality and zeal for the ministry.” Another temptation that has come to the
fore in modern times is the viewing
of pornography. Some have given in
to this temptation by allowing their
minds to dwell on what is bad. But
we can resist, even as thousands of
our brothers have done.—1 Cor. 10:
13. w15 6/15 5:15, 16

The kings of the earth, the high of?cials, the military commanders,
the rich, the strong, every slave,
and every free person hid in the
caves and among the rocks of the
mountains.—Rev. 6:15.
What will happen after the destruction of false religious organizations? It will be a time to reveal
what is really in our heart. The majority of mankind will seek refuge
in human organizations that are likened to “the rocks of the mountains.” Figuratively speaking, however, God’s people will ?ee to the

refuge that Jehovah provides. In
the ?rst century, the interval
was not a time for a mass conversion of Jews to Christianity. It was
a time for action and obedience on
the part of those who were already
Christians. Similarly, we cannot expect that the future interruption
in the great tribulation will result
in an in?ux of new believers. Rather, it will be an opportunity for all
true believers to prove their love for
Jehovah and give their support to
Christ’s brothers.—Matt. 25:34-40.

It is agreeable when someone endures hardship and su?ers unjustly
because of conscience toward God.
—1 Pet. 2:19.
Has your upbringing or environment exposed you to national or regional loyalties? Do any such feelings still linger in your heart?
Christians should not allow nationalistic fervor to taint their view of
others. But what if you realize that
you do have negative thoughts toward people of other nations, cultures, languages, or races? Then
it would certainly be pro?table to
meditate on how Jehovah views nationalism and prejudice. Researching these and related topics may
prove to be a worthwhile project.
Then petition Jehovah for help to
embrace his point of view on these
matters. (Rom. 12:2) We should do
this because sooner or later, all of
Jehovah’s servants will ?nd themselves in situations in which their
conscience obliges them to stand
out as di?erent from those around
them—whether colleagues, classmates, neighbors, relatives, or others. Yet, stand out we must! w15 7/15

Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God
from the belly of the ?sh.
—Jonah 2:1.
Jehovah hears our pleas and understands us even when no one else
does. His response to our prayers
is a beautiful expression of his enduring love for us. We can learn
much from prayers recorded in
God’s Word. At times, therefore,
we may ?nd it very bene?cial to
consider such prayers during family worship. Re?ecting on how Jehovah’s servants of the past expressed
their deepest thoughts to God may
help us to enrich our own prayers.
For instance, consider Jonah’s contrite prayer from the belly of a huge
?sh. (Jonah 1:17–2:10) Review Solomon’s heartfelt prayer to Jehovah
at the inauguration of the temple.
(1 Ki. 8:22-53) Meditate on the model prayer that Jesus o?ered for our
bene?t. (Matt. 6:9-13) Above all, regularly “let your petitions be made
known to God.” As a result, “the
peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts
and your mental powers.”—Phil. 4:

Be submissive.
—Heb. 13:17.
It will be a pleasure to be under
Jehovah’s arrangements in the new
world as we work toward beautifying the earth, teaching resurrected ones, and doing Jehovah’s will
for mankind. But what if we were directed to perform a particular
aspect of the work that did not appeal to us? Would we submit to that
direction by doing our best to carry out and even enjoy our assignment? Most of us would answer yes!
Consistently, then, are we submit-

ting to theocratic direction now? If
we are doing so, we are preparing
for everlasting life under Jehovah’s
rulership. We can prepare for life
in the new world not only by submitting to Jehovah’s present-day
arrangements but also by working
now to cultivate contentment and a
spirit of cooperation. If we cooperate with those taking the lead today,
perhaps ?nding contentment and
joy in new assignments of service,
we are likely to have the same attitude in the new world. w15 8/15 3:6, 7

His [pagan] wives inclined his
heart to follow other gods, . . . and
Solomon did what was bad in the
eyes of Jehovah.—1 Ki. 11:4, 6.
Solomon’s bad associations undermined his wisdom and caused
him to fall away from true worship.
(1 Ki. 11:1-6) What a warning that
is for Christians who might think
about marrying someone who does
not love Jehovah! What if someone
becomes a worshipper of God while
married to an unbeliever? The Bible
says: “You wives, be in subjection
to your husbands, so that if any are
not obedient to the word, they may
be won without a word through the
conduct of their wives.” (1 Pet. 3:1)
Those words are addressed to
Christian wives, but the same words
apply to a husband who becomes a
worshipper of Jehovah while married to an unbeliever. The Bible’s
counsel is clear: Be a good mate,
and live up to God’s high standards
for marriage. Many unbelieving
mates have accepted the truth because of observing a husband or a
wife who changed after complying
with God’s requirements. w15 8/15 4:

The naive person believes every
word, but the shrewd one ponders
each step.—Prov. 14:15.
For some illnesses, there may be
no known cure. So it is wise to
be cautious when it comes to treatments that feature stunning claims
but that are promoted merely with
hearsay testimonials. Paul was inspired to write: “Let your reasonableness become known to all
men.” (Phil. 4:5) Reasonableness
also holds us back from devoting so
much time to health care that
spiritual matters are forced into the
background. Were we to allow
health care to become the main focus of our life, we would run the risk
of becoming self-centered. (Phil.
2:4) Spiritual matters are most important, and with regard to health,
our expectations should remain
reasonable. (Phil. 1:10) On matters
like health care, each of us should
be willing to make a personal decision and accept the responsibility
that comes with it. w15 9/15 2:8, 10

Send out your light and your truth.
May these lead me.—Ps. 43:3.
Jehovah is “the God of truth.” (Ps.
31:5) He loves his children and
delights in letting his light of truth
shine forth to guide them in every
aspect of their life, particularly in
matters of worship. What truth has
Jehovah revealed, and how does
this show that he loves us? First of
all, Jehovah reveals the truth about
himself. He reveals his personal
name, which appears more times in

the Bible than any other name. In
this way, Jehovah draws close to us,
letting us know him. (Jas. 4:8) Jehovah also reveals his qualities, the
kind of God he is. While the observable universe makes manifest his
power and wisdom, Jehovah also reveals through the Scriptures his
justice and especially his boundless
love. (Rom. 1:20) He is like a father
who is not only strong and wise but
also fair and loving, making it easy
for his children to have a close personal relationship with him. w15 9/15

The hand of Jehovah will become
known to his servants.
—Isa. 66:14.
Many people think that there is little connection between what they
are doing and what God is doing. In
fact, some believe that God has little
interest in what is happening to humans. After Super Typhoon Haiyan
wreaked destruction on the central
Philippines in November 2013, the
mayor of one large city said: “God
must have been somewhere else.”
Other people act as if God cannot
see what they are doing. (Isa. 26:10,
11; 3 John 11) They are like those
whom the apostle Paul described
when he said: “They did not see
?t to acknowledge God.” Such people “were ?lled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, and badness.” (Rom. 1:28, 29) What about
us? Unlike those mentioned above,
we realize that Jehovah observes
everything we do. But do we also
perceive his interest and supporting
hand in our life? w15 10/15 1:1-3

Friday, September 22
I will show you my faith by my
works.—Jas. 2:18.
Sharing in the preaching work is
an excellent way to demonstrate
our faith. Why is that? This work requires that we have faith in God’s
timing of the coming end of this system of things, believing that “it will
not be late!” (Hab. 2:3) One way to
measure our faith is to look at the
extent to which we are willing to expend ourselves in the ministry. Are
we doing all we can, perhaps even
seeking ways to expand our share in
the work? (2 Cor. 13:5) Yes, making
“public declaration for salvation”
is a powerful way to show that we
have faith in our heart. (Rom. 10:10)
We can also show faith as we grapple with the challenges of daily life.
Whether we face illness, discouragement, depression, poverty, or
other trying problems, we have con?dence that Jehovah and his Son
will “help us at the right time.” (Heb.
4:16) We show such con?dence by
praying for help that is not limited
to our spiritual needs. w15 10/15 2:

Holy spirit . . . will . . . bring back
to your minds all the things I told
you.—John 14:26.
Although circumstances may deprive you of a Bible, you will never
be deprived of the ability to meditate on what you have stored in
your memory, such as your favorite
scriptures and the words of Kingdom songs. (Acts 16:25) And God’s
spirit can help bring back to
your mind the good things you have
learned. So prepare now by setting
aside time to read and meditate on

the weekly Bible reading. Time
should also be set aside for meditating on what Jesus said and did.
You will surely agree that among the
better-known books of the Bible are
the Gospel accounts of Jesus’ life
and ministry. (Rom. 10:17; Heb. 12:2;
1 Pet. 2:21) God’s people have even
been provided with a publication
that puts Jesus’ experiences and
time on earth in chronological order. It is a wonderful aid, especially if we carefully read and meditate
on the parallel Gospel passages cited in each chapter.—John 14:6.
w15 10/15 4:11, 12

Sunday, September 24
I have called you friends, because
I have made known to you all the
things I have heard from
my Father.—John 15:15.
Jesus was a loving and loyal
friend. In Bible times, a master
did not normally share his private thoughts and feelings with his
slaves. However, Jesus proved to
be both master and friend to his
faithful apostles. He spent time
with them, shared his feelings with
them, and carefully listened when
they poured out their hearts to him.
(Mark 6:30-32) Such loving communication created a warm bond
between Jesus and his apostles
and prepared them for future responsibilities in God’s service. Jesus wanted his beloved disciples and
friends to experience the joy that
comes from a busy life in Jehovah’s
service. Therefore, he desired that
they zealously participate in spiritual activities. Indeed, Jesus wanted
them to be ardent disciple-makers!
And he lovingly assured his disciples that he would help them to succeed.—Matt. 28:19, 20. w15 11/15 2:3, 5

Monday, September 25
You must love your neighbor as
yourself.—Matt. 22:39.
Love is Jehovah God’s dominant
quality. (1 John 4:16) His ?rst creation was Jesus, who existed with
him in heaven for many aeons and
learned God’s loving ways. (Col. 1:
15) By his entire course, including
his life on earth, Jesus showed that
he fully understands what a loving God Jehovah is, and he imitates
that love. Thus, we can be con?dent
that the rulership exercised by Jehovah and Jesus will forever be
guided by the quality of love. When
asked which was the greatest commandment in the Law, Jesus stated:
“‘You must love Jehovah your God
with your whole heart and with your
whole soul and with your whole
mind.’ This is the greatest and
?rst commandment. The second,
like it, is this: ‘You must love your
neighbor as yourself.’ ” (Matt. 22:3739) Notice that Jesus placed love of
neighbor second only to love of Jehovah. This shows how important it
is to display love in all our relationships. w15 11/15 4:1-3

Tuesday, September 26
All the things that were written
beforehand were written for our
instruction.—Rom. 15:4.
God did not restrict his communication with humans to Hebrew. After the Babylonian exile, Aramaic
became the everyday language of
some of God’s people. Perhaps to indicate what was to come, Jehovah
inspired the prophets Daniel and
Jeremiah and the priest Ezra to record portions of their Bible books in
Aramaic. Alexander the Great lat-

er conquered much of the ancient world, and common, or Koine,
Greek became an international language. Many Jews began to speak
that language, leading to the translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into
Greek. This translation, thought to
have been done by 72 translators,
became known as the Septuagint. It
was the ?rst translation of the Bible
and one of the most important. The
work of so many translators resulted in varied translation styles, from
literal to rather free. Nevertheless,
the Septuagint was viewed as God’s
Word by Greek-speaking Jews and
later by Christians. w15 12/15 1:4-6

Wednesday, September 27
See how small a ?re it takes to set
a great forest ablaze!—Jas. 3:5.
The point of James’ illustration is
made clear in verse 6. “The tongue
is also a ?re.” The tongue represents
our ability to speak. Like ?re, our
speech has the potential for causing
great harm. The Bible even says that
“death and life are in the power of
the tongue.” (Prov. 18:21) Of course,
we do not stop talking just out of
concern that we might say something harmful, any more than we refuse to use ?re because we fear the
damage it might cause. The key is
control. If we control ?re, we can use
it to cook our food, warm our bodies, and light up a dark night. If we
tame our tongue, we can use its
power to honor God and to bene?t
others. (Ps. 19:14) Whether we use
sounds from our mouth or signs with
our hands, the ability to communicate our thoughts and feelings is a
marvelous gift from God. This gift,
however, should be used to build up,
not tear down.—Jas. 3:9, 10. w15 12/15
3:1-3

Thursday, September 28
Luke, the beloved physician, sends
you his greetings.—Col. 4:14.
It is reasonable to believe that
Luke gave Paul medical advice
and rendered medical services to
him and to others in his missionary group. Why would Luke need to
do that? Because even Paul got
sick while traveling. (Gal. 4:13) Luke
could provide medical help that was
in line with what Jesus had said:
“Those who are healthy do not need
a physician, but those who are ill
do.” (Luke 5:31) The Bible does
not indicate where or when Luke received his medical training. It has
been suggested that Paul mentioned to Christians in Colossae the
role of Luke as a physician because
they knew him. Interestingly, there
was a medical school in nearby Laodicea. In any event, Luke was not
some untrained layman spouting
health recommendations; he was a
physician. That is evident both from
the speci?c medical language that
Luke used in his Gospel and in the
book of Acts and from the way he focused on Jesus’ healings of others.
w15 12/15 4:11, 12

Friday, September 29
Thanks be to God for his indescribable free gift.—2 Cor. 9:15.
When Jehovah sent his onlybegotten Son to this earth, He
gave what would become the greatest possible gift of love! (John 3:
16; 1 John 4:9, 10) The apostle Paul
called it God’s “indescribable free
gift.” Paul knew that all the magnificent promises of God were guaranteed through the perfect sacri?ce of Christ. (2 Cor. 1:20) Thus,
that “indescribable free gift” would
include all the goodness and loyal

love that Jehovah would extend to
us through Jesus. Indeed, that gift
is so awe-inspiring that it cannot
be fully described in human terms.
How should receiving such an extraordinary gift a?ect us? And in
what practical ways should this gift
motivate us? Does it compel you to
reconsider your actions and even
change the way you have been living your life? Are you moved to be
more generous and loving toward
others and to forgive any who have
wronged you? Remember, what Jehovah has given us through Christ
is by far the greatest gift ever given.
—1 Pet. 3:18. w16.01 2:1, 2, 4, 5

The wind blows where it wants to,
and you hear the sound of it, but
you do not know where it comes
from and where it is going. So it is
with everyone who has been born
from the spirit.—John 3:8.
Those who have been invited in
such a manner may wonder: ‘Why
have I been selected? Why me and
not someone else?’ They may even
question their own worthiness. But
they do not question the fact that
they have been invited. Their hearts
are bursting with joy and appreciation. They feel much as did Peter when he said under inspiration:
“Praised be the God and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, for according to his great mercy he gave us a
new birth to a living hope through
the resurrection of Jesus Christ
from the dead, to an incorruptible
and unde?led and unfading inheritance. It is reserved in the heavens
for you.” (1 Pet. 1:3, 4) When anointed ones read those words, they
know without any doubt that their
heavenly Father is speaking to them
personally. w16.01 3:11, 12

Sunday, October 1
Those whom he foreordained are
the ones he also called.
—Rom. 8:30.
Jehovah began choosing anointed ones after Jesus’ death and resurrection, and it seems that all in
the ?rst-century Christian congregation were anointed. From the ?rst
century until the beginning of the
last days, the vast majority of those
who claimed to follow Christ were
false Christians; Jesus likened them
to “weeds.” Even so, Jehovah continued to anoint some faithful
ones throughout that time, and they
proved to be like the “wheat” Jesus described. (Matt. 13:24-30) During the last days, Jehovah has continued to select those who will make
up the 144,000. If he chooses to wait
until late into that period to select
some for that privilege, who are we
to question his wisdom? (Isa. 45:9;
Dan. 4:35; Rom. 9:11, 16) We must be
careful not to react like the disgruntled workers who complained about
the way their master dealt with the
11th-hour workers.—Matt. 20:8-15.

Take, please, your son, your only
son whom you so love, Isaac, and
travel to the land of Moriah and
o?er him up there as a burnt o?ering on one of the mountains that I
will designate to you.—Gen. 22:2.
God does not make such requests
of us today. But he does ask us to
obey him even when his commands
are hard for us to comply with or we
cannot comprehend the reasons for
them. Can you think of something
that God asks of you that you ?nd
di?cult to do? For some, it may be

the preaching work. Perhaps they
struggle with shyness, making it
hard for them to approach strangers with the good news. For others,
it may be the challenge of standing
out as di?erent, perhaps at school
or in the workplace. (Ex. 23:2;
1 Thess. 2:2) Do you ever feel
like Abraham, as if you are trudging up that slope in Moriah, facing a
task that seems beyond you? If you
do, take courage from Abraham and
his faith! Meditating on examples of
faithful men and women can move
us to imitate them and draw close
to Jehovah as our Friend.—Heb. 12:
1, 2. w16.02 1:3, 14

Tuesday, October 3
Saul . . . spoke to Jonathan his son
and to all his servants about putting David to death.—1 Sam. 19:1.
Because Saul was determined to
kill David, Jonathan faced a con?ict
of loyalties. Although he had made a
covenant with David, Jonathan was
also submissive to his father. But
Jonathan knew that God was with
David and not with Saul. Therefore,
Jonathan put loyalty to David ahead
of loyalty to Saul. He warned David
to hide and then spoke well of him
to Saul. (1 Sam. 19:1-6) If we are
not careful, loyalty to a nation, a
school, or a sports team can eventually choke out loyalty to God. For example, Henry enjoys playing chess.
His school had a tradition of winning the championship, and he wanted to put forth his best e?ort. But
he admitted: “Gradually, loyalty to
the school began to take priority
over my loyalty to God. Weekend
chess matches were crowding out
my Kingdom service. So I decided
to give up being part of the chess
team.”—Matt. 6:33. w16.02 3:10, 12

Your people will o?er themselves
willingly.—Ps. 110:3.
As a young person, there are ways
in which you will be able to discern
whether your decision to get baptized comes from your heart. For
example, your heartfelt desire to
serve Jehovah will be re?ected in
your prayers. How often you pray
and how speci?c your prayers are
may well reveal how close your relationship with Jehovah is. (Ps. 25:4)
An important way that Jehovah answers our prayers is by directing
our attention to his Word. Thus, our
e?ort to study the Bible is yet another indication that we really want to
draw closer to Jehovah and serve
him from the heart. (Josh. 1:8) So
ask yourself: ‘How speci?c are my
prayers? How regular is my personal study of the Bible?’ And if your
Christian family has a Family Worship evening, ask yourself: ‘Do I
willingly share in that arrangement?’ Your answers to these questions will help you to see whether
your decision to get baptized is your
personal desire. w16.03 1:11, 13

From him all the body is harmoniously joined together and made to
cooperate.—Eph. 4:16.
What a thrill it is to read in the
Yearbook the combined results of
our activity! Think, too, of how we
are united at regional, special, and
international conventions, as we listen to motivating Scriptural talks
and give attention to dramas
and demonstrations. These parts often highlight God’s loving appeal to serve him with all our being.
The commemoration of Jesus’
death also unites us. With apprecia-

tion for God’s undeserved kindness
and in obedience to Jesus’ direction, we gather for that event yearly,
after sundown on Nisan 14. (1 Cor.
11:23-26) And in the weeks before
the Memorial, we cover as much of
our congregation’s territory as possible, inviting others to join us for
that important occasion. Our individual e?orts might seem insignificant. But by working together, we
are able to direct the attention of
millions of people to the one who
deserves all praise and honor, Jehovah! w16.03 3:4, 6, 7

Friday, October 6
This is my Son, the beloved, whom
I have approved.—Matt. 3:17.
Brothers who are learning to
serve in the congregation should
be taught to think in terms of Bible principles. For example, suppose an elder asks a brother to keep
the entranceway to the Kingdom
Hall clean in appearance and safe
for walking. He could consider Titus 2:10 and explain how the brother’s work to enhance the Kingdom
Hall will “adorn the teaching of our
Savior, God.” He could also ask the
learner to think of the elderly ones
in the congregation and how carrying out his assignment will bene?t them. Having such conversations
with the learner as part of his training will help him to focus more on
people than on rules. He will experience the joy that comes from seeing how brothers and sisters in the
congregation bene?t from the service he renders. Further, the elder
should commend the learner for the
e?ort he makes to apply the suggestions. Sincere commendation does
for a learner what water does for a
plant—it makes him thrive. w15 4/15

The Lord will rescue me from every
wicked work.—2 Tim. 4:18.
Have you at times felt all alone in
dealing with a di?cult situation?
It could have been lack of employment, pressures at school, a
health problem, or some other distressing circumstance. Perhaps you
asked for assistance, but others disappointed you by falling far short
of providing what you needed. Indeed, some problems simply cannot be solved by mere human help.
Under such circumstances, is the
Bible’s counsel to “trust in Jehovah” empty advice? (Prov. 3:5, 6) Is
it meaningless? Certainly not! Divine help is very real, as illustrated
by numerous Bible accounts. Therefore, rather than nurture resentment when human help appears to
be limited, view such situations as
the apostle Paul did—as opportunities to rely fully on Jehovah and experience ?rsthand his loving care.
This will strengthen your trust in
him and make your relationship
with him ever more real. w15 4/15

Sunday, October 8
The god of this system of things
has blinded the minds of the
unbelievers.—2 Cor. 4:4.
Only by being deceptive can Satan turn people against the loving
God, Jehovah. (1 John 4:8) Through
deception, Satan keeps people from
becoming “conscious of their spiritual need.” (Matt. 5:3) He has
thus “blinded the minds of the unbelievers, so that the illumination of
the glorious good news about
the Christ, who is the image of God,
might not shine through.” One of
Satan’s greatest means of decep-

tion is false religion. How pleased
he must be to see people worship their ancestors, or nature, or
animals—anyone or anything other than Jehovah, “who requires exclusive devotion”! (Ex. 20:5) Even
many who think that they are worshipping God properly are shackled
to false beliefs and useless rituals.
They are in a pitiable state, much
like that of those whom Jehovah implored: “Why spend your earnings
for what brings no satisfaction? Listen intently to me, and . . . ?nd great
delight in what is truly rich.”—Isa.
55:2. w15 5/15 1:14, 15

He will crush your head, and you
will strike him in the heel.
—Gen. 3:15.
Abel likely gave much thought to
that promise and realized that someone would be ‘struck in the heel’
so that mankind could be lifted to
perfection such as that enjoyed by
Adam and Eve before they sinned.
Abel had faith based on God’s promise, and Jehovah therefore accepted
his sacri?ce. (Gen. 4:3-5; Heb. 11:4)
Noah survived the Deluge because
of his faith. (Heb. 11:7) After the
Flood, he was moved by faith to
o?er animal sacri?ces. (Gen. 8:20)
Like Abel, he undoubtedly had faith
that mankind would eventually be
released from bondage to sin and
death. As he entered the dark postFlood era during which Nimrod acted in opposition to Jehovah, Noah
still had faith and hope. (Gen. 10:812) Very likely, he would have been
heartened to think about mankind
as being set free from oppressive
rule, inherited sin, and death. We
too can “see” such a wonderful time
—and it is near indeed!—Rom. 6:23.

Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it
down, but a good word cheers it
up.—Prov. 12:25.
Uncontrolled anxious thoughts
can cause us physical and spiritual
harm. Let us trust in Jehovah
and remember the words of today’s
text. Good words of encouragement
from someone who understands us
can make our heart rejoice. Con?ding in our parents, our spouse,
or a trusted friend who views things
from God’s standpoint may help to
relieve our anxiety. No one understands our anxiety better than Jehovah does. “Do not be anxious
over anything,” wrote Paul, “but in
everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving, let
your petitions be made known to
God; and the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard
your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.” (Phil.
4:6, 7) Think about those who are
helping to protect us from spiritual
harm—fellow believers, elders, the
faithful slave, angels, Jesus, and Jehovah himself. w15 5/15 4:16, 17

Wednesday, October 11
One man was there who had been
sick for 38 years.—John 5:5.
Just north of the temple at Jerusalem was a pool known as Bethzatha. Large crowds of sick and in?rm
people would gather there, hoping that they would be miraculously cured. Moved with pity, Jesus approached a man who had been sick
longer than Jesus had been alive on
earth. (John 5:6-9) Jesus inquired if
he wanted to get well. The response
was immediate. The man wanted to
be healed but he could not see how,
for he had no one to help him into

the pool. Jesus then commanded
the man to do the impossible—to
pick up his mat and walk. Taking Jesus at his word, the man picked up
his mat and began to walk. What a
heartwarming foregleam of what
Jesus will do in the new world! In
this miracle, we also see Jesus’ compassion. He sought out the needy.
Jesus’ example should motivate us
to continue to seek out people in
our territory who are depressed
about the terrible things happening
in this world. w15 6/15 2:8-10

Thursday, October 12
You must pray . . . this way.
—Matt. 6:9.
The expression “our Father,” not
“my Father,” reminds us that we belong to an “association of brothers”
who truly love one another. (1 Pet.
2:17) What a precious privilege that
is! Anointed Christians, who have
been begotten as God’s sons
with heavenly life in view, rightly
address Jehovah as “Father” in the
fullest sense. (Rom. 8:15-17) Christians whose hope is to live forever
on earth can also address Jehovah
as “Father.” He is their Life-Giver,
and he lovingly provides for the
needs of all true worshippers.
Those with this earthly hope will
in the fullest sense become God’s
children after they have reached
perfection and have proved their
loyalty in the ?nal test. (Rom. 8:21;
Rev. 20:7, 8) Parents give their children a ?ne gift when they teach
them to pray and help them to view
Jehovah as a caring heavenly Father. Parents can give their children
no greater gift than that of helping
them to develop a warm, close relationship with Jehovah. w15 6/15

Friday, October 13
Deliver us from the wicked one.
—Matt. 6:13.
To live in harmony with the request “deliver us from the wicked
one,” we must strive to be “no part
of [Satan’s] world.” We must “not
love either [Satan’s] world or
the things in the world.” (John 15:
19; 1 John 2:15-17) Doing so is an ongoing struggle. What a relief it will
be when Jehovah answers this request by removing Satan and causing his wicked world to pass away!
We must remember, though, that
when Satan was hurled out of heaven, he knew that his time was short.
Enraged, he does all he can to make
us break our integrity. So we must
keep praying for deliverance from
him. (Rev. 12:12, 17) Do you desire
such a happy outcome? Then continue to pray for God’s Kingdom to
sanctify God’s name and cause his
will to be done on earth. Look to Jehovah to supply your spiritual and
physical needs. Yes, be determined
to live in harmony with the model
prayer.—Matt. 6:9-13. w15 6/15 5:12,
17, 18

Saturday, October 14
There will be great tribulation.
—Matt. 24:21.
Although we do not fully understand all that will happen during that time of test, we can expect
that it will involve some measure of
sacri?ce. In the ?rst century, Christians had to leave behind their possessions and endure hardships in
order to survive. (Mark 13:15-18) To
remain faithful, will we be willing to
experience material loss? Will we be
ready to do whatever is required of

us to prove our loyalty to Jehovah?
Just think! At that time, we will be
the only ones following the example of the ancient prophet Daniel by
continuing to worship our God no
matter what. (Dan. 6:10, 11) This will
not be the time to preach the “good
news of the Kingdom.” That time
will have passed. The time for “the
end” will have come! (Matt. 24:14)
No doubt God’s people will proclaim
a hard-hitting judgment message.
This may well involve a declaration
announcing that Satan’s wicked
world is about to come to its complete end. w15 7/15 2:3, 8, 9

Sunday, October 15
They are no part of the world, just
as I am no part of the world.
—John 17:16.
We should not be surprised
if the world hates us for our neutral stand; Jesus warned us that it
would. Most opposers do not appreciate the importance of the issues
involved in Christian neutrality. For
us, though, these are matters of utmost importance. Loyalty to Jehovah requires that we be steadfast
in the face of threats. (Dan. 3:16-18)
Fear of man can a?ect people of all
ages, but young people may ?nd it
especially di?cult to go against the
?ow, so to speak. If your children
are facing such issues as the ?ag salute or nationalistic celebrations,
do not hesitate to assist them. Use
Family Worship sessions to help
your children understand the issues involved so that they can meet
those challenges courageously.
Help them to express their personal convictions clearly and respectfully. (Rom. 1:16) Take the initiative
to speak with their teachers about
these matters if necessary. w15 7/15

God loved the world so much that
he gave his only-begotten Son.
—John 3:16.
The undeserved gift of Jesus’ ransom sacri?ce was given so that “we
might gain life.” (1 John 4:9) Referring to this superlative expression of God’s love, the apostle Paul
wrote: “Christ died for ungodly men
at the appointed time. For hardly
would anyone die for a righteous
man; though perhaps for a good
man someone may dare to die. But
God recommends his own love to us
in that, while we were yet sinners,
Christ died for us.” (Rom. 5:6- 8)
This greatest expression of God’s
love opened to mankind the prospect of having a favored standing
with Jehovah. By means of the ransom, Jehovah shows his love for the
world of mankind. If we hope to live
forever on earth and we continue to
serve Jehovah faithfully, we can be
assured that he will make life pleasant for us in the new world. How ?tting it is that we view the ransom as
the greatest evidence of God’s enduring love for us! w15 8/15 1:13, 15

Tuesday, October 17
Do not feel sad.
—Neh. 8:10.
The privilege of living under Kingdom rule is well worth any e?ort we
make to cooperate with Jehovah’s
organization and care for theocratic assignments. Of course, our
circumstances may change. For instance, some members of the Bethel
family in the United States have
been reassigned to the ?eld and
are now enjoying abundant blessings in other forms of the full-time
ministry. Because of advancing age
or other factors, others who were

in the traveling work have now received special pioneer assignments.
If we cultivate contentment, pray
for God’s help, and do all we can in
his service, we will experience
joy and will receive many blessings even in these critical last days.
(Prov. 10:22) What about our future
prospects? We may have ideas
about where we would like to live in
the new world, but we may be asked
to move to a di?erent area. Regardless of where we will then serve and
what we will do, we can be sure that
we will be grateful and contented,
brimming with joy. w15 8/15 3:8

[Noah] proved himself faultless
among his contemporaries.
—Gen. 6:9.
Noah lived in an evil world but
had no desire to make its inhabitants his close friends. He did not
seek the companionship of ungodly
people. He and the seven members of his family occupied themselves with the doing of God-given
work, which included building an
ark. Meanwhile, Noah was also “a
preacher of righteousness.” (2 Pet.
2:5) Noah’s preaching, his work on
the ark, and his association with
his family kept him busy doing good
things that pleased God. As a result, Noah and his immediate family survived the Flood. We should be
grateful to them because all of us
today are the descendants of
those who served Jehovah—faithful Noah, Noah’s wife, his sons, and
their wives. Similarly, loyal and obedient ?rst-century Christians kept
themselves separate from ungodly
people and survived the destruction of Jerusalem and the Jewish
system of things in 70 C.E.—Luke
21:20-22. w15 8/15 4:17, 18

[There is] a time to laugh . . . and
a time to dance.—Eccl. 3:4.
Not every pastime is bene?cial, relaxing, or refreshing; nor
is it good to engage in recreation too much or too often. How
can our conscience help us to enjoy upbuilding recreation and bene?t from it? The Scriptures warn
against certain behavior identi?ed
as “the works of the ?esh.” These
works include “sexual immorality,
uncleanness, brazen conduct, idolatry, spiritism, hostility, strife, jealousy, ?ts of anger, dissensions, divisions, sects, envy, drunkenness,
wild parties, and things like these.”
Paul wrote that “those who practice
such things will not inherit God’s
Kingdom.” (Gal. 5:19-21) Accordingly, we can ask ourselves: ‘Does my
conscience move me to shun sports
that are aggressive, competitive,
nationalistic, or violent? Does my
inner voice warn me when I am
tempted to view a ?lm that features
pornographic scenes or one that
condones immorality, drunkenness,
or spiritism?’ w15 9/15 2:11, 12

I well know, O Jehovah, that man’s
way does not belong to him. It does
not belong to man who is walking
even to direct his step.—Jer. 10:23.
From the Bible we learn that humans are not created with the
right of self-determination, to be independent of God, and that ignoring this fundamental truth will have
sad consequences. This is critically important to our welfare. Only by
recognizing God’s authority can we
enjoy peace and harmony. How lov-

ing of Jehovah that he chooses to
reveal this important truth! A loving
father is deeply concerned about
the future of his children, wanting
them to have a real and meaningful
purpose in life. Regrettably, most
people are in the dark about the future, or they spend their life pursuing goals that bring no lasting bene?ts. (Ps. 90:10) As God’s children,
we feel truly loved because Jehovah has promised us a wonderful future. That gives genuine meaning
and purpose to our life. w15 9/15 4:

There will be no dew or rain except
by my word!—1 Ki. 17:1.
In Israel’s early history, people had the opportunity to see and
hear about how God acted in Israel’s behalf. Jehovah miraculously
delivered his people out of Egypt,
and then king after king fell before
them. (Josh. 9:3, 9, 10) Israel’s opponents refused to acknowledge that
God was ?ghting for Israel, and that
led to their defeat. Later, wicked
King Ahab had every opportunity
to see God’s hand in events. Ahab
saw ?re come down from heaven
when Elijah prayed for his o?ering
to be consumed. Elijah then indicated that Jehovah would bring the
drought they were experiencing to
an end, telling Ahab: “Go down so
that the downpour may not detain
you!” (1 Ki. 18:22-45) Ahab saw all of
this happen but still refused to acknowledge that it was a mighty display of God’s power. This and other
examples teach us an important lesson—we must recognize Jehovah’s
hand when it is in action. w15 10/15

The righteous one will live by
reason of faith.—Gal. 3:11.
We must never doubt that if we
follow God’s direction, it will turn
out for our good. It is vital that we
put faith in the One who can really help. Paul reminds us that God is
“the one who can, according to his
power that is operating in us, do
more than superabundantly beyond
all the things we ask or conceive.” (Eph. 3:20) Jehovah’s servants do all they can to carry out
the will of God, but knowing their
limitations, they trust in Jehovah to
bless the outcome. Are we not glad
that our God is with us? Can we expect our requests for more faith to
be answered? The Bible assures us
that we can when “we ask according
to [God’s] will.” (1 John 5:14) Clearly, Jehovah is pleased with those
who put their complete trust in him.
Jehovah will answer our request for
more faith, and our faith will grow
exceedingly, leading to our being
“counted worthy of the Kingdom of
God.”—2 Thess. 1:3, 5. w15 10/15 2:
16-18

Monday, October 23
Never drift away.
—Heb. 2:1.
Meditating on spiritual things will
help a person grow to Christian maturity. (Heb. 5:14; 6:1) A person who
spends little time thinking about Jehovah and Jesus will not maintain
strong faith. Such a person is in
danger of drifting away or drawing
away from the truth. (Heb. 3:12) Jesus warned that if we do not hear,
or accept, God’s Word “with a ?ne
and good heart,” we will not “retain” it. Instead, we could easily be
“carried away by anxieties, riches,

and pleasures of this life, . . . and
bring nothing to maturity.” (Luke 8:
14, 15) Therefore, let us continue
to ponder over God’s Word. This
will motivate us to re?ect Jehovah’s
glory, qualities, and personality as
revealed in the Bible. (2 Cor. 3:18)
What more could we ask for? Growing in the knowledge of God and
being allowed to re?ect his glory
are wonderful privileges, a neverending process as we continue to
learn how to imitate our loving heavenly Father.—Eccl. 3:11. w15 10/15 4:

Wisdom is good for you. If you ?nd
it, you will have a future.
—Prov. 24:14.
As parents, you want your teenage children to remain spiritually
healthy. And God wants you to
bring your children up “in the discipline and admonition of Jehovah.”
(Eph. 6:4) So use your God-given responsibility to establish and maintain a spiritual routine. To illustrate: You insist that your children
be educated because their education is important and you hope
to instill in them a love for learning.
Loving parents likewise insist
that their children bene?t from the
“admonition of Jehovah” at congregation meetings and through other spiritual programs. Because divine education is vital, you try to
instill in your children love for spiritual things and appreciation for wisdom. As Jesus helped his disciples,
you seek to help your teenage children to succeed in the ministry by
developing in them a love of teaching God’s Word and by helping them
stick to a good ?eld service routine.

The head of every man is the
Christ; in turn, the head of a woman is the man; in turn, the head of
the Christ is God.—1 Cor. 11:3.
Because of the headship principle that exists throughout God’s arrangement of things, love is especially important. But headship is
not to be exercised in a domineering way. Although a husband is the
head of his wife, the Bible instructs him to ‘assign her honor.’
(1 Pet. 3:7) One way husbands can
honor their wives is by taking into
consideration their needs and giving them ?rst choice in some
matters. Indeed, God’s Word states:
“Husbands, continue loving your
wives, just as the Christ also loved
the congregation and gave himself up for it.” (Eph. 5:25) Yes, Jesus
even gave his life for his followers.
When a husband imitates the loving
way in which Jesus exercises headship, it is much easier for a wife to
love and respect him and be in subjection to him.—Titus 2:3-5. w15 11/15
4:6, 7

Thursday, October 26
The Greek-speaking Jews began
complaining against the Hebrewspeaking Jews.—Acts 6:1.
As Christianity spread, much
communication among Christians
was in Greek. In fact, the Gospels
of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
which contain inspired records
of what Jesus taught and did, were
widely distributed in Greek. Thus,
the language of many disciples was
Greek rather than Hebrew. The letters of the apostle Paul and the oth-

er inspired books were also distributed in Greek. It is noteworthy that
when writers of the Christian Greek
Scriptures quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures, they usually did so
from the Septuagint. These quotations, which at times vary somewhat
from the exact Hebrew wording, are
now part of the inspired Scriptures.
Thus, the work of imperfect human
translators became part of the inspired Word of God, a God who does
not favor one culture or language
over another.—Acts 10:34. w15 12/15

Friday, October 27
O Jehovah, open my lips, so that
my mouth may declare your praise.
—Ps. 51:15.
Speech is part of our daily life,
but we do not need to talk all
the time. In fact, the Bible says that
there is “a time to be silent.” (Eccl.
3:7) Maintaining silence when others are speaking can be a mark of
respect. (Job 6:24) Controlling our
tongue to keep quiet about a con?dential matter gives evidence of discretion and discernment. (Prov. 20:
19) Restraining our tongue when we
are provoked is the course of wisdom. (Ps. 4:4) On the other hand,
the Bible also says that there is “a
time to speak.” (Eccl. 3:7) If a friend
gave you a beautiful present, you
would probably not store it out of
sight. Rather, you would show your
appreciation by putting it to good
use. We show our gratitude for Jehovah’s gift of speech by using it
wisely. That might include expressing our feelings, communicating
our needs, sharing words of encouragement, and giving God praise.

Do not drink water any longer, but
take a little wine for the sake of
your stomach and your frequent
cases of sickness.—1 Tim. 5:23.
We do not live at a time when a fellow Christian can use “gifts of healing” to cure us. (1 Cor. 12:9) But some
well-intentioned brothers give unsolicited health recommendations.
Granted, someone might simply
o?er general, practical suggestions.
Paul did so when Timothy was experiencing stomach problems, perhaps because the local water was
polluted. That, however, is quite different from trying to persuade a fellow Witness to use some herb, remedy, or diet that may not be e?ective
or in some cases may even be harmful. At times, some have tried to persuade others with an explanation:
‘My relative had a similar disease,
and he took . . . Then he got well.’ No
matter how sincere the suggestion,
we do well to keep in mind that
there may be risks even with widely
used medications and treatments.
—Prov. 27:12. w15 12/15 4:13

Christ died once for all time for
sins, a righteous person for unrighteous ones.—1 Pet. 3:18.
Because of inherited sin, we are
all facing the death penalty. (Rom.
5:12) Lovingly, Jehovah arranged
for Jesus to come to the earth and
“taste death for everyone.” (Heb.
2:9) Not only did Jehovah save our
present life but he laid the basis for
wiping out the cause of death forever. (Isa. 25:7, 8; 1 Cor. 15:22, 26) All
who exercise faith in Jesus will receive everlasting life in peace and

happiness as earthly subjects of
God’s Kingdom by Christ or, for the
anointed, as corulers in that Kingdom. (Rom. 6:23; Rev. 5:9, 10) What
other blessings are included in this
gift from Jehovah? Jehovah’s gift
includes the curing of all our sicknesses, the transformation of our
earth into a paradise, and the resurrection of the dead. (Isa. 33:24; 35:
5, 6; John 5:28, 29) We surely love
Jehovah and his dear Son for giving us what is an “indescribable free
gift.”—2 Cor. 9:15. w16.01 2:5, 6

Monday, October 30
You people must be born again.
—John 3:7.
Before receiving this personal
witness from God’s spirit, anointed Christians cherished an earthly
hope. They longed for the time
when Jehovah would cleanse this
earth, and they wanted to be part
of that blessed future. Perhaps they
even pictured themselves welcoming back their loved ones from the
grave. They looked forward to living in the homes that they built
and eating the fruitage of trees that
they planted. (Isa. 65:21-23) Why did
their thinking change? They did not
become dissatis?ed with that hope.
They did not change their mind because of emotional stress or turmoil. They did not give up on this
earth, as if they suddenly felt that
they would ?nd living forever on
earth to be tiresome or boring; nor
did they merely want to explore
some new frontier in heaven. Rather, they changed because of the operation of God’s spirit that not only
called, or invited, them but also
changed their thinking and hope.

Jehovah is the Supreme One, the
Creator of all things, the One possessing in?nite wisdom and power. Job came to understand that.
After Jehovah questioned Job
about His works of creation, Job replied: “I know that you are able to
do all things and that nothing you
have in mind to do is impossible for

you.” (Job 42:2) Though Jehovah
can accomplish whatever he sets
out to do—without assistance—he
has from the very beginning lovingly invited others to work along with
him to achieve his purpose. God’s
?rst creation was his only-begotten
spirit Son. Jehovah allowed his Son
to share in all further works of creation, both spirit and material.
(John 1:1-3, 18) Thus, Jehovah honored his Son both by including him
in the works of creation and by telling others about his Son’s important role.—Col. 1:15-17. w16.01 5:1, 2

Abraham breathed his last and
died at a good old age, old and
satis?ed.—Gen. 25:8.

You son of a rebellious woman, do
you think I do not know that you
are choosing to side with the son
of Jesse, to your own shame and to
the shame of your mother?
—1 Sam. 20:30.

Working together with him, we
also urge you not to accept the undeserved kindness of God and miss
its purpose.—2 Cor. 6:1.

When we read that Abraham was
“old and satis?ed,” let us not conclude that he had had his ?ll of life,
so to speak, and had no desire to
live in the future. The Bible says of
Abraham: “He was awaiting the city
having real foundations, whose designer and builder is God.” (Heb. 11:
10) Can you imagine how thrilled
Abraham will be to live in the earthly Paradise and go on strengthening
his friendship with Jehovah? How
touched he will be to learn that his
example of faith helped Jehovah’s
servants throughout thousands of
years after his death! In Paradise he
will even learn that the way Isaac
was restored to him was “illustrative” of something far greater. (Heb.
11:19) And he will learn that the pain
he su?ered as he prepared to sacri?ce Isaac has helped millions of
faithful people to imagine Jehovah’s own pain as he provided his
Son, Jesus Christ, as the ransom.
—John 3:16. w16.02 1:15, 16

Our loyalty to Jehovah may be
challenged if someone in a responsible position misjudges us. Jonathan may have faced such a challenge. King Saul, the anointed of
God, was aware of his son’s friendship with David, but he did not understand the reason for it. Saul humiliated Jonathan in an angry
outburst. However, Jonathan did
not retaliate. He did not waver in
his loyalty to God or to David, who
would in time become Israel’s king.
(1 Sam. 20:31-41) In congregations
of Jehovah’s people today, it is very
unlikely that we would be treated
unjustly. However, those taking the
lead among us are imperfect men
and could misinterpret our actions. (1 Sam. 1:13-17) If we are ever
misjudged or misunderstood, let us
remain loyal to Jehovah. w16.02 3:

If anyone wants to come after me,
let him disown himself and pick up
his torture stake.—Matt. 16:24.
Some might be confused about
the di?erence between dedication
and baptism. For example, some
young people say that they have
made a dedication to Jehovah but
are not ready to get baptized. Does
that make sense? Making a dedication means telling Jehovah that you
will serve him forever. At baptism, a
person shows others that he is dedicated. Therefore, baptism is a public expression of a private dedication that you have already made in
prayer to Jehovah. Before you get
baptized, you need to be sure that
you understand what dedication
means. Simply stated, when you
dedicate your life to Jehovah, you
give up ownership of yourself. You
promise Jehovah that you will put
the doing of his will ahead of everything else in your life. Any promise
should be taken seriously, but how
much more so a promise made to
Jehovah God!—Matt. 5:33. w16.03 1:

Let us by love grow up in all
things.—Eph. 4:15.
Using the example of the human
body, Paul focused on unity under
the head of the congregation, Jesus Christ. The apostle spoke of cooperating “through every joint that
gives what is needed.” (Eph. 4:16)
How can each of us, whether young
or old, strong or frail, contribute to
the unity and spirituality of the congregation? A key is to submit ourselves to and respect those whom
Jesus has designated to provide direction in the congregation, the el-

ders. (Heb. 13:7, 17) We may not always ?nd this easy to do. However,
we can with con?dence request
God’s guidance. His active force can
help us to support the congregation
arrangements wholeheartedly. So
if we on occasion do not feel inclined to follow the direction given,
we should re?ect on how our humbly cooperating will contribute to
the unity in the congregation. Furthermore, cooperating in matters
like these will likely help all of us to
grow in love. w16.03 3:8, 9

Sunday, November 5
The word of God is alive and
exerts power.—Heb. 4:12.
While they were growing up,
some young brothers were not encouraged to pursue spiritual goals.
The truth never came ?rst in the
life of such young ones. (Matt. 10:
24) Therefore, an elder should
take time to develop a friendly relationship with a brother he wishes
to train for congregation privileges
and let him know that he is needed in the congregation. Then, over
the course of time, the elder
should sit down with the brother to
reason on speci?c scriptures and
help him think about his dedication
to Jehovah. (Eccl. 5:4; Isa. 6:8; Matt.
6:24, 33; Luke 9:57-62; 1 Cor. 15:58;
2 Cor. 5:15; 13:5) The elder might ask
him, ‘What did you promise Jehovah when you dedicated yourself to
him?’ He could try to stir his heart
by asking, ‘How do you think Jehovah must have felt when you got
baptized?’ (Prov. 27:11) ‘What were
Satan’s feelings?’ (1 Pet. 5:8) Elders
should never underestimate how
deeply a brother can be a?ected by
the reading of carefully selected Bible passages. w15 4/15 2:9, 11

Monday, November 6
Throw all your anxiety on him,
because he cares for you.
—1 Pet. 5:7.
Why does Jehovah not give us an
immediate response to our every
request? Recall that he likens
our relationship with him to that
of children with a father. (Ps. 103:
13) A child cannot rightly expect
a parent to grant every request or
to do so right away. Some of a
child’s requests may be mere passing whims. Others must wait till the
time is right. Still others may not be
in the child’s best interests or in the
best interests of others involved.
Furthermore, to concede immediately to a child’s every request
would change the relationship to
one of master and slave, the child
being the master. Similarly, Jehovah may in our best interests allow
time to pass before his response to
our prayers becomes evident. That
is his prerogative as our wise Creator, loving Master, and heavenly
Father. Ful?lling all our requests
right away would distort the proper relationship between us and him.
—Isa. 29:16; 45:9. w15 4/15 4:6, 7

Oppose the Devil, and he will ?ee
from you.—Jas. 4:7.
As we near the end of this system
of things, Satan wants us to relax
our guard, to “be kind” to ourselves
by carving out a niche in this world,
thus losing our sense of urgency. Do
not let that happen to you! Instead,
“keep on the watch.” (Matt. 16:22,
23; 24:42) Never believe Satan’s deceptive propaganda that the end is
far o?—or that it is not coming at
all. Satan tries to have us believe

that from God’s standpoint we are
unlovable and our sins are unforgivable. That is all part of Satan’s deceptive propaganda. After all, who
is particularly and really unlovable
in Jehovah’s eyes? It is Satan. Who
is really unforgivable? Again, it is
Satan. But the Bible assures us:
“God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you
showed for his name.” (Heb. 6:10)
Jehovah appreciates our e?orts to
please him, and our service is not in
vain. (1 Cor. 15:58) So let us not be
fooled by Satan’s deceptive propaganda. w15 5/15 1:16-19

They saw them from a distance
and welcomed them.—Heb. 11:13.
Abraham had so much evidence
to demonstrate the reality of
what he hoped for that it was as if
he could see what he had not actually beheld! Abraham’s faith in God’s
promises strengthened his resolve
to do the divine will. Acting in faith,
he left the city of Ur and refused to
take up permanent residence in any
of the cities of Canaan. Like Ur, they
had shaky foundations because of
their ungodly governments. (Josh.
24:2) For the rest of his long life,
Abraham “was awaiting the city
having real foundations, whose designer and builder is God.” (Heb. 11:
10) Abraham “saw” himself living in
a permanent place governed by Jehovah. Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and others like them believed
in the resurrection of the dead and
looked forward to life on earth under God’s Kingdom, “the city having real foundations.” Re?ecting on
such blessings bolstered their faith
in Jehovah.—Heb. 11:15, 16. w15 5/15

Christ is the power of God.
—1 Cor. 1:24.
Jehovah displayed his power
through Jesus Christ in extraordinary ways. The four Gospels
provide faith-strengthening details
about some of the miracles that
Christ performed. Likely, he performed many other miracles. (Matt.
9:35; Luke 9:11) Yes, God’s power
was manifested in Jesus. For good
reason, then, the apostle Paul could
say about him: “Christ is the power
of God.” Yet, what bearing can Jesus’ miracles have on our life? The
apostle Peter said that Jesus
performed miracles, or “wonders.”
(Acts 2:22) The powerful works
that Jesus did on earth were foregleams of even grander blessings
to come under his kingly rule. They
foreshadow the miracles that Jesus will perform in God’s new world
on a global scale! His miracles also
give us tremendous insight into his
personality and that of his Father.

She kept saying: “If I touch just his
outer garments, I will get well.”
—Mark 5:28.
Realizing that it was his Father,
Jehovah, who had healed the woman, Jesus treated her kindly, saying: “Daughter, your faith has made
you well. Go in peace, and be healed
from your grievous sickness.”
(Mark 5:34) How kind Jesus is! We
see that he has a warm place in his
heart for those who su?er from illnesses. Satan wants to convince us
that we are unloved and worth-

less. By his miracles, Jesus clearly proved that he truly cares about
us and our problems. What a sympathetic King and High Priest! (Heb. 4:
15) It may not be easy for us to understand the feelings of those who
su?er from a chronic illness, especially if we have never experienced
such. We can bear in mind that Jesus empathized with the sick even
though he himself was never sick.
May Jesus’ example move us to do
the same, to the best of our ability.

The name of God is being blasphemed among the nations
because of you.—Rom. 2:24.
What a privilege it is for us not
only to know God’s personal
name but also to bear it as “a people for his name.” (Acts 15:14; Isa.
43:10) We implore our heavenly Father: “Let your name be sancti?ed.”
(Matt. 6:9) Your making such a request may move you to ask Jehovah
to help you to avoid doing or saying
anything that would dishonor his
holy name. We do not want to be like
some in the ?rst century who did
not practice what they preached, as
mentioned in today’s text. What is
needed for God’s name to be completely sancti?ed and cleared of all
reproach? For that to happen, Jehovah must act to remove all who willfully reject his sovereignty. (Ezek.
38:22, 23) Mankind will gradually be
brought to perfection. How we long
for the time when all intelligent creation will treat Jehovah’s name as
holy! Then, at last, our loving heavenly Father will “be all things to
everyone.”—1 Cor. 15:28. w15 6/15 4:

The heavens are my throne, and
the earth is my footstool.
—Isa. 66:1.
Besides referring to the earth, the
term “footstool” is also employed
?guratively in the Hebrew Scriptures to describe the ancient temple used by the Israelites. (1 Chron.
28:2; Ps. 132:7) Located on the
earth, the temple served as the center of true worship. For that reason,
it was truly beautiful in Jehovah’s
eyes and its very existence glori?ed
the place for Jehovah’s feet. (Isa.
60:13) Today the center of true worship is no longer a literal temple on
earth. There is, however, a spiritual
temple, which glori?es Jehovah far
more than any building. This is an
arrangement that makes reconciliation with God possible by means of
the priesthood and sacri?ce of Jesus Christ. It came into existence in
29 C.E. at Jesus’ baptism when Jesus was anointed as High Priest of
Jehovah’s great spiritual temple.

They will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and
great glory.—Luke 21:27.
This will be a time for rewarding
those who are faithful and for punishing those who are not. (Matt. 24:
46, 47, 50, 51; 25:19, 28-30) According to Matthew, Jesus ?nished
giving the composite sign with the
parable of the sheep and the goats,
saying: “When the Son of man
comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit down
on his glorious throne. All the na-

tions will be gathered before
him, and he will separate people
one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the
goats. And he will put the sheep on
his right hand, but the goats on his
left.” (Matt. 25:31-33) What judgment will the sheep and the goats
hear pronounced on them? The parable ?nishes with the words: “These
[the goats] will depart into everlasting cutting-o?, but the righteous
ones into everlasting life.”—Matt.

Look! How good and how pleasant
it is for brothers to dwell together
in unity!—Ps. 133:1.
It is understandable that we might
feel some a?ection for the land, the
culture, the language, and the food
of the country we were raised in.
However, we must avoid the “mine
is best” attitude. For our pleasure,
Jehovah has created great variety
in all things. (Ps. 104:24; Rev. 4:11)
So why insist that one way of doing
things is superior to another? God
wants people of all sorts to come to
an accurate knowledge of truth and
to enjoy everlasting life. (John 3:
16; 1 Tim. 2:3, 4) Open-mindedness
toward a diversity of acceptable
ideas enriches us and protects our
Christian unity. As we maintain our
loyalty to Jehovah, we must avoid
involvement in the world’s controversies. Partisan allegiances have
no place among us. How thankful we are to Jehovah for freeing us
from the divisive, prideful, competitive practices that dominate Satan’s
world! w15 7/15 3:17, 18

[God] cares for you.
—1 Pet. 5:7.
There are many ways to express
our love for Jehovah. For example, we show love for God and neighbor by having a zealous share in the
Kingdom-preaching work. (Matt. 24:
14; 28:19, 20) We show that we truly love Jehovah by enduring tests of
faith as integrity keepers. (Ps. 84:
11; Jas. 1:2-5) If our trials become
severe, we can be sure that God is
aware of our su?ering and will help
us, for we are precious to him. (Ps.
56:8) Our love for Jehovah moves
us to meditate on his creative
works and other marvelous deeds.
We show that we love God and highly value his Word by diligently
studying the Bible. Love for Jehovah draws us ever closer to him in
prayer. And our love for God grows
deeper as we re?ect on the ransom
sacri?ce he provided for our sins.
(1 John 2:1, 2) These are just some
of the many reasons we have for loving Jehovah in response to his enduring love for us. w15 8/15 1:6, 17, 18

Thursday, November 16
[It is] better to be patient.
—Eccl. 7:8.
In the new world, there may be
times when we will need to exercise
patience. For example, we may hear
of individuals who, to the delight
of their relatives and friends, have
been raised from the dead. However, we ourselves may have to wait
for the resurrection of our loved
ones. If that is the case, will we rejoice with others and be patient?
(Rom. 12:15) Learning to wait pa-

tiently for the ful?llment of Jehovah’s promises now will help us to
exercise patience then. We can also
prepare for life in the new world by
exercising patience regarding revealed truth. Are we studious and
patient as our understanding of Bible truth is progressively clari?ed
today? If so, we will likely have no
di?culty showing patience in the
new world as Jehovah makes known
his requirements for mankind.
—Prov. 4:18; John 16:12. w15 8/15 3:

Attain . . . the measure of stature
that belongs to the fullness of the
Christ.—Eph. 4:13.
The apostle Paul wrote of the
need for Christians in Ephesus
to grow spiritually. He encouraged
them to reach out to “attain to the
oneness of the faith and of the accurate knowledge of the Son of God,
to being a full-grown man, attaining the measure of stature that belongs to the fullness of the Christ.”
(Eph. 4:13) When Paul wrote his letter, the congregation in Ephesus
had already existed for some years.
Many disciples there had reached a
high level of spiritual development.
Some, however, still needed to
press on to maturity. The situation
among Jehovah’s Witnesses today
is much the same. Many brothers
and sisters have long served God
and have advanced to spiritual maturity. But obviously not all are at
that point. For example, thousands
of new ones are baptized each year,
so some still need to strive for maturity. What about you?—Col. 2:6, 7.
w15 9/15 1:2, 3

Saturday, November 18
Physical training is bene?cial for a
little.—1 Tim. 4:8.
Many have concluded that a measure of regular exercise promotes
good health and refreshes the body
and mind. If we want to enjoy exercise in a group, should we share in
it with just anyone? Proverbs 13:20
tells us: “The one walking with the
wise will become wise, but the
one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly.” Does this not
suggest that we should be selective
in our choice of recreation, guided by our Bible-trained conscience?
There is also the question of when
to engage in recreation. Do you plan
recreation around theocratic activities, such as meetings, ?eld ministry, and personal study? Or do you
?nd yourself trying to ?t theocratic activities between periods of leisure? What are your priorities? Jesus said: “Keep on, then, seeking
?rst the Kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will
be added to you.” (Matt. 6:33) Does
your conscience prompt you to set
priorities that line up with Jesus’
advice? w15 9/15 2:13, 15

Sunday, November 19
Why are you so angry and dejected? If you turn to doing good, will
you not be restored to favor? . . .
Will you get the mastery over
[sin]?—Gen. 4:6, 7.
That was timely counsel coupled
with positive direction. Jehovah
thus warned Cain when it was apparent that Cain was on a very dangerous course. Sadly, Cain did not
heed that warning, and he su?ered
for it. (Gen. 4:11-13) When Jeremi-

ah’s secretary, Baruch, felt weary
and despondent, Jehovah gave him
counsel to help him see the reality
of his problem. Unlike Cain, Baruch
accepted Jehovah’s counsel, and
this preserved his life. (Jer. 45:2-5)
“Those whom Jehovah loves he disciplines, in fact, he scourges everyone whom he receives as a son,”
wrote Paul. (Heb. 12:6) Discipline,
however, is not limited to punishment. It takes various forms. There
are many examples in the Bible
of faithful servants undergoing extreme trials that may have involved
discipline and that trained them.
w15 9/15 4:12, 13

Monday, November 20
Your servants have come . . . out
of regard for the name of Jehovah your God, because we have
heard about his fame and about all
he did.—Josh. 9:9.
The Gibeonites wisely recognized
Israel’s backer to be the true God.
Rahab too perceived God’s hand in
the events of her day. After learning about how Jehovah rescued his
people, she told two Israelite spies:
“I do know that Jehovah will give
you the land.” Even though taking
such a stand was fraught with danger, she expressed faith that Jehovah could deliver her and her family. (Josh. 2:9-13; 4:23, 24) These and
many other examples in the Bible
help us to understand what it means
to see God or to see his hand in matters. As we come to know him, we
too can see his hand because we
perceive his qualities and actions
with “the eyes of [our] heart.” (Eph.
1:18) Surely we want to be like those
past and present who have clearly seen Jehovah supporting his people. w15 10/15 1:6, 7, 9

Tuesday, November 21
Jesus loved Martha and her sister
and Lazarus.—John 11:5.
Although Martha was the only
woman mentioned by name as being
one whom Jesus loved, he also had
pure unsel?sh love for other godly women, such as his dear earthly mother, Mary, and Martha’s sister, Mary. (John 19:25-27) Why,
then, is Martha mentioned in this
way in the Gospel account? Jesus
loved Martha not only for her hospitable and industrious nature but,
no doubt, because of her spirituality. She was a woman who truly
believed Jesus’ teachings. Martha
had remarkable faith in Jesus as the
promised Messiah. (John 11:21-27)
At the same time, like all of us, she
was not perfect. On one occasion
while Jesus was being entertained
in her home, Martha presumed to
tell Jesus what he should do to correct a situation she thought to be
wrong. “Lord,” said Martha, “does it
not matter to you that my sister has
left me alone to attend to things?
Tell her to come and help me.”
—Luke 10:38-42. w15 10/15 3:1, 2

Wednesday, November 22
Draw close to God, and he will
draw close to you.
—Jas. 4:8.
By continuing to ponder over spiritual things, we will maintain our enthusiasm for the truth. Thus we will
be a source of refreshment to our
brothers and to the interested ones
we meet in the ?eld service. Meditating deeply on God’s greatest gift,

the ransom sacri?ce of Jesus, will
help us to cherish the privilege of
having a close relationship with our
Holy Father, Jehovah. (Rom. 3:24)
Mark, a South African who spent
three years in prison because of his
Christian neutrality, said: “Meditation can be compared to an exciting adventure. The more we meditate on spiritual things, the more
we discover new things about our
God, Jehovah. At times when I’m
feeling a little discouraged or anxious about the future, I pick up the
Bible and meditate on a passage of
Scripture. I feel that it really calms
me down.” w15 10/15 4:15

Thursday, November 23
Give me understanding, so that I
may observe your law and keep it
with my whole heart.—Ps. 119:34.
When appropriate, explain to your
children the reasons behind a rule
or a decision you make. If a teenager
understands your thinking on the
matter, he is more likely to obey you
from a willing heart. “Giving reasons helps teenagers to trust you because they see that your decisions
are not arbitrary or capricious but
reasonable,” says Barry, who raised
four children. A teenager is also maturing into an adult with his own
“power of reason.” (Rom. 12:1) Barry
explains: “Teenagers need to learn
to make sensible decisions based on
reason rather than emotion.” When
you humbly give reasons for your decisions, your adolescent can sense
that you recognize that he is progressing toward maturity, and he
learns to make his own decisions
with his “power of reason.” w15 11/15
2:11

Friday, November 24
Let us work what is good toward
all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.—Gal. 6:10.
Throughout the earth, there are
millions who worship Jehovah and
bear witness to his name and purpose. How should each worshipper
of Jehovah view his fellow Witnesses? (Rom. 12:10) The apostle Peter
wrote: “Now that you have puri?ed
yourselves by your obedience to the
truth with unhypocritical brotherly
a?ection as the result, love one another intensely from the heart.” Peter also told fellow believers:
“Above all things, have intense love
for one another.” (1 Pet. 1:22; 4:8)
Because we have intense love
for our fellow servants of Jehovah,
we make up a unique worldwide organization. Moreover, because we
love Jehovah and obey his laws, he
supports us with the most powerful
force in the universe, his holy spirit, or active force. This enables us to
enjoy wonderful unity as a truly international brotherhood.—1 John 4:
20, 21. w15 11/15 4:8, 9

Saturday, November 25
Ten men out of all the languages
of the nations . . . [will say]: “We
want to go with you.”—Zech. 8:23.
Jehovah does not insist that we
learn a speci?c language in order
for us to get to know him or his purposes. (Rev. 7:9, 10) Has God’s communication with humans been hindered by the use of di?erent
languages and minor variations
in translation? No. For example, we
may be aware of only a few of the
original-language words that Jesus

used. (Matt. 27:46; Mark 5:41; 7:34;
14:36) However, Jehovah made sure
that Jesus’ message was transmitted in Greek and, in time, in other
languages. Later, Bible manuscripts
were copied again and again by
Jews and Christians, preserving the
holy writings. These were translated into many more languages. John
Chrysostom of the fourth/?fth century C.E. said that by his day, Jesus’ teachings had been translated
into the languages of the Syrians,
Egyptians, Indians, Persians, Ethiopians, and innumerable other peoples. w15 12/15 1:10, 11

Sunday, November 26
A word spoken at the right time
—how good it is!—Prov. 15:23.
Our words may be just what our
hearer truly needs, but unless we
discern the best time to speak, their
meaning could be lost. For example,
in March 2011 an earthquake and
tsunami devastated parts of eastern Japan, wiping out entire cities.
More than 15,000 lost their lives. Although Jehovah’s Witnesses in the
area su?ered along with their
neighbors, they took advantage of
every opportunity to use the Bible
to comfort those who were mourning. However, many of the local people have deep-rooted Buddhist beliefs and little or no knowledge of
Bible teachings. Our brothers discerned that immediately following
the tsunami was not necessarily the
best time to tell the grief-stricken
victims about the resurrection
hope. Instead, they used their gift of
speech to focus on giving emotional
support and explaining from the Bible why such terrible things happen
to innocent people. w15 12/15 3:7

Monday, November 27
The naive person believes every
word, but the shrewd one ponders
each step.—Prov. 14:15.
Sadly, in this greedy world, there
are those who seize on people’s illness as an opportunity to make
money. Other individuals or companies stress the use of products that
are high-priced in order to make
large pro?ts. To a sick person who
desperately seeks relief or a way to
stay alive longer, these “cures”
may seem appealing. “The shrewd
one” will be particularly cautious
if the “word,” or recommendation,
comes from someone whose quali?cations are questionable. “The
shrewd one” might reason: ‘He
says that this vitamin, herb, or diet
supposedly helped someone, but
are there adequate witnesses to establish the matter? People di?er. Is
there valid reason to trust that it
will help me? Should I do more research or even consult with some
who are known to be trained or
quali?ed in this ?eld?’—Deut. 17:6.
w15 12/15 4:14, 15

Tuesday, November 28
The love the Christ has compels
us.—2 Cor. 5:14.
Paul realized that we could
not accept the extraordinary love
of Christ without being compelled,
or moved, to live for him. When our
minds fully comprehend what Jehovah has done for us and our hearts
are moved by his love, we desire to
live our lives whole-souled for
Christ Jesus. How do we show that
desire? Those who love Jehovah are
compelled to imitate Christ’s example, following his steps closely.

(1 Pet. 2:21; 1 John 2:6) Through our
obedience, we prove our love for
God and Christ. Jesus said: “Whoever has my commandments and observes them is the one who loves
me. In turn, whoever loves me will
be loved by my Father, and I will
love him.” (John 14:21; 1 John 5:3)
So ask yourself: ‘In what areas am I
doing well in following in the steps
of Christ Jesus? In what areas could
I improve?’ This self-examination
is vital, as we are constantly being
pressured to follow the ways of this
world.—Rom. 12:2. w16.01 2:7-9

Wednesday, November 29
We will be like him, because we will
see him just as he is.—1 John 3:2.
Do you feel that you have more
than average zeal in the ministry? Are you a keen student of God’s
Word who loves to delve into
“the deep things of God”? (1 Cor. 2:
10) Have you seen Jehovah’s special blessing on your ministry? Do
you have a burning desire to do Jehovah’s will? Do you have a deep inner feeling of responsibility to
help others spiritually? Have you
seen proof that Jehovah has personally intervened in your life? If
you answer these questions with a
resounding yes, does this mean that
you now have the heavenly calling?
No, it does not. Why not? Because
these are not unique feelings experienced only by those who have the
heavenly calling. Jehovah’s spirit
works with equal force in those who
have the hope of living forever on
earth. In fact, if you are wondering whether you have received the
heavenly calling, that would in itself
indicate that you have not received
it. w16.01 3:14, 15

I rejoiced before him all the time.
—Prov. 8:30.
Jesus joyfully worked alongside
his Father, rejoicing both in what
he accomplished and in the knowledge that Jehovah was fond of him.
What, though, about us? Jesus said
that there is happiness both in giving and in receiving. (Acts 20:35) It
brought us joy to receive the truth,
and it brings us joy to share the
truth with others. As we share Bible truths with others, we see spiritually hungry ones ?lled with de-

light as they begin to understand
and appreciate our God and the precious truths contained in his
Word. It touches our heart to see
them make changes not just in their
thinking but also in their way of life.
We realize that the work of sharing
the good news is vitally important.
It opens the way to everlasting life
for those who become reconciled to
God. (2 Cor. 5:20) What more joyful,
satisfying work could we engage in
than that of helping people chart a
course that will result in their living
forever? w16.01 5:6, 7

Close friendship with Jehovah
belongs to those who
fear him.—Ps. 25:14.

I have come . . . to do, not my own
will, but the will of him who sent
me.—John 6:38.

Three times the Bible identi?es
Abraham as God’s friend. (2 Chron.
20:7; Isa. 41:8; Jas. 2:23) In fact, that
faithful man is the only person speci?cally referred to that way in the
Bible. Should we assume, then, that
Abraham was the only human ever
to become Jehovah’s friend? No, for
the Bible shows that friendship with
God is something that each of us
can attain. God’s Word teems with
accounts of faithful men and women who feared Jehovah, put faith in
him, and became his close friends.
The apostle Paul wrote of “a great
cloud of witnesses,” all of whom
surely were God’s friends. (Heb.
12:1) Among them we ?nd a delightful variety of people. They have enjoyed the wonderful privilege of being friends of God. May we continue
to imitate such examples of faith.
(Heb. 6:11, 12) As we do so, we may
be assured of a great reward—being Jehovah’s close friends forever!
w16.02 2:1, 2, 19

Imagine that a friend gives you a
car as a gift. He hands you the title
and says: “I will keep the keys. And I
will be the one who drives the car,
not you.” How would you feel? Now
think about what Jehovah rightfully
expects of a person who makes a
dedication to him, a person who tells
him: “I am giving you my life. I belong
to you.” What if that person were to
start living a double life, perhaps secretly dating an unbeliever? What if
he were to accept employment that
crippled his whole-souled service in
the ministry or attendance at Christian meetings? Would that not be like
keeping the keys to the car? A person who dedicates himself to Jehovah is, in e?ect, saying: “My life belongs to you more than to me. If
there is ever a con?ict between what
you want and what I am inclined to
want, what you want will win—every
time.” That would re?ect the thinking of Jesus, as stated in today’s
text. w16.03 1:16, 17

I will not leave you.
—2 Ki. 2:2.
Nearly 3,000 years ago, the prophet Elijah invited young Elisha to become his attendant. Elisha promptly
accepted the invitation and faithfully served the older man by caring
for humble tasks. (2 Ki. 3:11) Then,
after some six years of training, Elisha learned that Elijah’s work in Israel was about to come to an end.
At that point, Elijah urged his welltrained companion to stop following him, but Elisha was determined
to stay with his mentor as long as
possible. If you are a young brother, how can you imitate Elisha today? Promptly accept assignments,
including humble tasks. View your
teacher as a friend, and let him
know how much you appreciate the
e?ort he makes in your behalf.
Above all, be faithful in carrying
out any assignment you are given.
Why is this so important? Because
only after you demonstrate that you
are faithful and reliable will the elders feel assured that Jehovah
wants you to be entrusted with added responsibilities in the congregation.—Ps. 101:6; 2 Tim. 2:2. w15 4/15

Monday, December 4
He does not go back on his promise, even when it is bad for him.
—Ps. 15:4.
Saul urged Jonathan to pursue
his own interests. (1 Sam. 20:31) But
loyalty to God moved Jonathan to
befriend David rather than seek the
advantages of the kingship for himself. Jonathan did not “go back on
his promise” to David; neither
should we go back on our promis-

es. For example, if a business agreement becomes harder to honor than
expected, our loyalty to God and regard for the Bible should move us to
keep our word. And what if our marriage proves to be more challenging than anticipated? Love for
God will surely move us to be loyal to our mate. (Mal. 2:13-16) Also,
let us prove our loyalty to Jehovah
by being loyal to his people, even
those who may disappoint us. When
we are loyal to Jehovah God in the
face of challenging situations, we
make his heart rejoice. (Prov. 27:
11) If we remain loyal to Jehovah,
we will see how he eventually works
everything out for the good of those
who love him. w16.02 3:16, 17

Tuesday, December 5
Happy are all those keeping in
expectation of him.—Isa. 30:18.
Jehovah is fully aware of our limitations. (Ps. 103:14) Therefore, he
does not expect us to endure trials
in our own strength but o?ers us his
fatherly help. Of course, at times,
we might feel that we cannot go on
anymore. But Jehovah assures us
that he will never allow his servants
to su?er beyond their limit of endurance. Yes, he will “make the way
out.” (1 Cor. 10:13) Therefore,
we have good reason to trust that
Jehovah’s assessment of what we
can bear is right. When relief does
not immediately follow our prayers
for help, let us wait on the One who
knows just when to act in our behalf. Remember that he too is exercising patience, for he is ever eager
to come to our rescue. “Jehovah is
waiting patiently to show you favor,
and he will rise up to show you mercy. For Jehovah is a God of justice.”

This is how the holy women of the
past who hoped in God used to
adorn themselves, subjecting themselves to their husbands.
—1 Pet. 3:5.
During Family Worship sessions,
we focus on spiritual matters, and
this contributes to the unity of the
family. Practicing for the ?eld ministry can equip the family to be better prepared to preach e?ectively.
And it is not hard to see that when
members of a family share comments about God’s Word, they
are drawn closer together—all love
the same God and all are interested in doing his will. What can married couples do to cooperate to Jehovah’s praise? When both mates
are faithful servants of Jehovah,
they can rejoice in the unity that
this a?ords them. Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Elkanah
and Hannah—all expressed their
love for their mate. We should make
it a point to do the same. (Gen. 26:8;
1 Sam. 1:5, 8) That will unite us with
our mate and draw us closer to our
heavenly Father.—Eccl. 4:12. w16.03

Thursday, December 7
Take your stand against [Satan],
?rm in the faith.—1 Pet. 5:9.
Satan is at war with the anointed remnant and the “other sheep.”
(John 10:16) The Devil’s goal is to
devour as many of Jehovah’s
servants as he can in the short time
that he has left. (Rev. 12:9, 12) Can
we win our ?ght against Satan? Yes!
The Bible says: “Oppose the Devil, and he will ?ee from you.” (Jas.
4:7) Many sco? at the idea that Satan even exists. To them, Satan and

the demons are ?ctional characters
of novels, horror movies, and video games. Such people feel that no
intelligent person believes in wicked spirits. Now, do you think that
it bothers Satan that he and his invisible cohorts have been relegated to the world of folklore? That is
not likely! After all, it is easy for Satan to blind the minds of those who
doubt that he exists. (2 Cor. 4:4)
Promoting the idea that spirits do
not exist is one of the many ways
that Satan uses to mislead people.
w15 5/15 2:1, 2

Friday, December 8
[Moses] considered the reproach
of the Christ to be riches greater than the treasures of Egypt, for
he looked intently toward the payment of the reward.—Heb. 11:26.
From his natural parents, Moses
evidently learned about Jehovah and His purpose to free the Hebrews from slavery and give them
the Promised Land. (Gen. 13:14, 15;
Ex. 2:5-10) As Moses thought deeply about what Jehovah had promised to do for the Israelites, his faith
and his love for God grew. Like other God-fearing humans, he could
likely conceive of the time when Jehovah would set mankind free from
death. (Job 14:14, 15; Heb. 11:17-19)
It is no wonder that Moses was
moved to love the God who felt compassion for the Hebrews and for all
mankind. Faith and love motivated Moses throughout his life. (Deut.
6:4, 5) Even when Pharaoh threatened Moses with death, his faith,
love for God, and likely a mental
picture of a bright future strengthened him to face the threat courageously.—Ex. 10:28, 29. w15 5/15 3:
11-13

They have no wine.
—John 2:3.
At a marriage feast in Cana of Galilee, Jesus performed his ?rst miracle. The number of guests may
have been greater than expected.
But whatever the case, the wine ran
out. Among the guests was Mary,
Jesus’ mother. For years, she had
no doubt pondered all the prophetic
promises associated with her son,
who she knew would be called “Son
of the Most High.” (Luke 1:30-32; 2:
52) Did she believe that in him there
were powers not yet revealed? What
is evident is that at Cana, Mary and
Jesus felt compassion for the newly
married couple and wanted to save
them embarrassment. Jesus knew
that hospitality was a duty. So he
miraculously turned some 100 gallons (380 L) of water into “?ne
wine.” (John 2:6-11) Was Jesus obligated to perform this miracle? No.
He simply cared about people and
was imitating his heavenly Father
by being generous. w15 6/15 1:3

Sunday, December 10
Lord, are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?
—Acts 1:6.
Before Jesus ascended to heaven,
his apostles asked the above. Jesus’
answer showed that it was not the
time for them to know when God’s
Kingdom would start ruling. He told
his disciples to focus on the important witnessing work that they
needed to do. (Acts 1:7, 8) Nevertheless, Jesus taught his followers to
look forward to the coming of God’s
Kingdom. So Christians since the

days of the apostles have been praying for it to come. When the time
approached for God’s Kingdom in
the hands of Jesus to start ruling
from heaven, Jehovah helped his
people to understand the timing of
events. In 1876, an article written by
Charles Taze Russell was published
in the magazine Bible Examiner. That
article, “Gentile Times: When Do
They End?,” pointed to 1914 as a signi?cant year. The article linked the
“seven times” of Daniel’s prophecy
with “the appointed times of the nations” spoken of by Jesus.—Dan. 4:
16; Luke 21:24. w15 6/15 4:11, 12

Monday, December 11
Jesus gave way to tears.
—John 11:35.
Jesus’ heart was touched by
the pain of others. Deeply moved
by others’ reaction to the death of
his friend Lazarus, Jesus “groaned”
and “became troubled.” He felt that
way even though he knew that he
would shortly bring Lazarus back to
life. (John 11:33-36) Jesus was not
ashamed to manifest strong emotions. Onlookers could see the affection Jesus felt for Lazarus and
his family. What compassion Jesus
showed by using his God-given power to bring his friend back to life!
(John 11:43, 44) The Bible describes
Jesus as “the exact representation
of [the Creator’s] very being.” (Heb.
1:3) Thus, by his miracles, Jesus
proved that he and his Father have
the desire to undo the pain of sickness and death. This desire extends
far beyond the few resurrections
recorded in the Bible. Jesus stated: “The hour is coming in which all
those in the memorial tombs will . . .
come out.”—John 5:28, 29. w15 6/15

Let them praise your great name.
—Ps. 99:3.
Unlike some religious people who
mistakenly think that they will
praise God once they have left the
earth and gone to heaven, all of Jehovah’s Witnesses realize the need
to praise him here and now on the
earth. We thereby follow the example of the faithful servants of Jehovah described at Psalm 99:1-3, 5. As
that psalm indicates, Moses, Aaron, and Samuel o?ered their full
support to the arrangement for true
worship in their day. (Ps. 99:6, 7)
Today, before moving on to serve
as priests with Jesus in heaven,
the remaining ones of his anointed brothers faithfully serve in the
earthly courtyard of the spiritual
temple. Millions of “other sheep”
loyally support them. (John 10:16)
Although having di?erent hopes,
both groups unitedly worship Jehovah here at God’s footstool. As individuals, however, we do well to ask
ourselves, ‘Am I giving full support
to Jehovah’s arrangement for pure
worship?’ w15 7/15 1:4, 5

Wednesday, December 13
Keep in expectation of it!
—Hab. 2:3.
Jehovah’s worshippers have long
lived in expectation of the ful?llment of inspired prophecies. Isaiah,
who foretold that Jehovah would
bring about a restoration after Judah’s desolation, declared: “Happy
are all those keeping in expectation
of him.” (Isa. 30:18) Micah, whose
prophecies also involved God’s ancient people, personally resolved:
“I will keep on the lookout for Jehovah.” (Mic. 7:7) For centuries, God’s
servants also lived in expectation

of the ful?llment of prophecies concerning the Messiah, or Christ.
(Luke 3:15; 1 Pet. 1:10-12) God’s
present-day servants also keep in
expectation, for prophecies about
the Messiah are still undergoing
ful?llment. Through the Messianic Kingdom, Jehovah will soon put
an end to human su?ering by destroying the wicked and delivering
his people from this unstable world
lying in Satan’s power. (1 John 5:19)
Let us therefore remain alert and
fully aware that this system is rapidly nearing its end. w15 8/15 2:1, 2

The zeal for your house will
consume me.—John 2:17.
At Jehovah’s direction, the Israelites built the tabernacle.
(Ex. 25:8) Later, they constructed
a temple for the worship of Jehovah. (1 Ki. 8:27, 29) After returning
from exile in Babylon, the Jews regularly gathered in synagogues.
(Mark 6:2; John 18:20; Acts 15:21)
Early Christians met in the homes
of members of the congregation.
(Acts 12:12; 1 Cor. 16:19) Today, Jehovah’s people meet for education
and worship in tens of thousands
of Kingdom Halls worldwide. So
great was Jesus’ love and appreciation for Jehovah’s temple in Jerusalem that a Gospel writer attributed to him the prophetic sentiment
found in today’s text. (Ps. 69:9) No
Kingdom Hall can rightly be called
“the house of Jehovah” in the same
sense that these words applied to
the temple in Jerusalem. (2 Chron.
5:13; 33:4) Even so, the Bible contains principles that show us how
our modern-day places of worship
should be used and respected.
w15 7/15 4:1, 2

Clothe yourselves with love.
—Col. 3:14.
Will we be able to deal lovingly with one another during Christ’s
Thousand Year Reign? If we learn
to forgive freely and if we avoid
strained relations now, it will be easier for us to do so then. (Col. 3:12, 13)
Life in the new world may not mean
that we will always get what we want
when we want it. Instead, that life
will involve being appreciative and
content in any situation as we bene?t from submitting to Jehovah’s loving sovereignty. It will mean putting
into practice the very qualities that
Jehovah is teaching us to cultivate
now. By learning to live now as we
expect to live then, we are developing qualities that we will need
to manifest for all eternity. We are
strengthening our faith in the reality of “the inhabited earth to come.”
(Heb. 2:5; 11:1) Moreover, we are
showing how deeply we yearn for the
righteous conditions that will then
exist on earth. Indeed, we are preparing for everlasting life in God’s
new world. w15 8/15 3:11, 12

Saturday, December 16
Go on walking in union with
[Jesus].—Col. 2:6.
When you examine ripe fruit at
the market, you see that not all
the pieces are identical. Yet, they
do share some characteristics that
identify them as being ripe. Similarly, mature Christians may be of
di?erent nationality, background,
health, age, and experience. There
are even di?erences in personality
or culture. Still, all who grow spiritually develop qualities that identify them as being mature. How so?
A mature servant of Jehovah builds

his life around the example of Jesus, who left a model for us “to follow his steps closely.” (1 Pet. 2:21)
What did Jesus highlight as being
very important? Loving Jehovah
with all one’s heart, soul, and mind,
and loving one’s neighbor as oneself. (Matt. 22:37-39) A mature
Christian strives to live in harmony with that counsel. He has established a life pattern that shows that
he gives priority to his relationship
with Jehovah and he displays selfsacri?cing love for others. w15 9/15
1:3-5

Sunday, December 17
By making the truth manifest, we
recommend ourselves to every human conscience in the sight of
God.—2 Cor. 4:2.
A good conscience does much
more than warn us against wrongdoing. It moves us to do good
works. Foremost among these good
works is our participation in the
ministry from house to house and
our taking advantage of opportunities to witness informally. Paul’s
conscience moved him to do so. He
wrote: “Necessity is laid upon me.
Really, woe to me if I do not declare
the good news!” (1 Cor. 9:16) As we
imitate him, our conscience speaks
to us, assuring us that we are doing the right thing. And by preaching the good news, we appeal to
the conscience of those to whom
we speak. Yes, the conscience can
be an invaluable tool. By regularly immersing ourselves in God’s
Word, meditating on what we ?nd,
and striving to put it into practice,
we train our conscience. It will thus
prove to be a valuable asset in our
Christian life! w15 9/15 2:16, 18

Monday, December 18
Those whom Jehovah loves he
reproves.—Prov. 3:12.
Accounts of Joseph, Moses, and
David are among the most detailed and vivid of all Bible characters. Reading about how Jehovah was with them throughout their
trials and how they came to be used
mightily by Jehovah makes us feel
all the more Jehovah’s care and love
for his servants. Discipline from Jehovah helps us see another aspect
of his love. When those who have
done wrong are disciplined by Jehovah and they respond and repent,
“he will forgive in a large way.” (Isa.
55:7) What does that mean? David
gave a touching description of Jehovah’s forgiveness in these words:
“He forgives all your errors and
heals all your ailments; he reclaims
your life from the pit and crowns
you with his loyal love and mercy.”
(Ps. 103:3, 4) May we always be sensitive to Jehovah’s counsel, even his
discipline, and be quick to respond,
recognizing that it is an expression
of his boundless love for us.—Ps.
30:5. w15 9/15 4:13, 14

Tuesday, December 19
Mary . . . kept listening to what
[Jesus] was saying.—Luke 10:39.
Martha is busy preparing a special
meal for Jesus, and she becomes irritated with Mary. Jesus notices that
Martha is trying to do too much,
so he kindly says: “Martha, Martha,
you are anxious and disturbed about
many things.” He then suggests that
just one dish of food would be suf?cient. Jesus now turns his attention to Mary and clears her of any
negligence, saying: “For her part,

Mary chose the good portion, and it
will not be taken away from her.”
(Luke 10:38-42) Mary may soon have
forgotten what she ate on that special occasion, but she would never
forget the commendation and ?ne
spiritual food she received by giving
Jesus her undivided attention. More
than 60 years later, the apostle John
wrote: “Jesus loved Martha and her
sister.” (John 11:5) These inspired
words surely indicate that Martha
took to heart Jesus’ loving correction and that she strove to serve Jehovah faithfully for the rest of her
life. w15 10/15 3:3, 4

Wednesday, December 20
The power beyond what is normal
[is] God’s.—2 Cor. 4:7.
We have ample reason to believe
that Jehovah is active in people’s
lives today. Time and again, we have
heard experiences of how individuals prayed for spiritual help and
then received it. (Ps. 53:2) While
preaching from house to house on
a small island in the Philippines, Allan met a woman who started to cry.
He states: “Just that morning,
she prayed to Jehovah that his Witnesses would ?nd her. God answered her prayer so quickly that
she was visibly moved.” Within a
year, she dedicated her life to Jehovah. Many of God’s servants have
seen evidence of his help when they
broke free from such addictive habits as smoking, drug abuse, or the
viewing of pornography. Some say
that they repeatedly tried to stop on
their own but were not successful.
However, when they turned to Jehovah for help, he supplied “the power beyond what is normal,” and they
?nally conquered their weakness.
—Ps. 37:23, 24. w15 10/15 1:10, 11

Thursday, December 21
[Make] the best use of your time.
—Eph. 5:16.
Some get up early in the morning
to read, meditate, and pray. Others
do so during their lunch break. You
might ?nd that this can be done early in the evening or before you go to
bed. Some enjoy reading the Bible
in the morning and again before retiring. Thus they “read it . . . day and
night,” or regularly. (Josh. 1:8) The
important thing is to buy out time
from less important things for daily meditation on God’s Word. God’s
Word repeatedly promises blessings to all who meditate on it and
who strive to apply what they learn.
(Ps. 1:1-3) “Happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it,”
said Jesus. (Luke 11:28) Most important, meditating on spiritual
things each day will help us to bring
honor to the Grand Creator of our
marvelous brain, and he will reward
us with happiness now and everlasting life in his righteous new world.
—Jas. 1:25; Rev. 1:3. w15 10/15 4:17, 18

Friday, December 22
Peter took [Jesus] aside and began
to rebuke him, saying: “Be kind to
yourself, Lord; you will not have
this happen to you at all.”
—Matt. 16:22.
The apostle Peter meant well
when he urged Jesus to be kind to
himself in order not to be killed. Jesus, however, knew that Peter’s
comment re?ected faulty thinking.
To help him and the other disciples,
Jesus gave frank counsel, stated
the consequences of a self-sparing
attitude, and outlined the blessings
of a self-sacri?cing spirit. (Matt.
16:21-27) Peter learned the lesson.

(1 Pet. 2:20, 21) Pray to Jehovah to
give you insight so that you can understand where your teenager
needs help. (Ps. 32:8) For example,
what might indicate that your
child’s faith is wavering? Perhaps
his joy is waning, he is speaking
critically of fellow believers, or he
has become secretive. Do not hastily conclude that these are signs of a
double life involving serious sin. On
the other hand, do not ignore such
signs or dismiss your teenager’s isolation as a mere phase. w15 11/15 2:

Clothe yourselves with the tender
a?ections of compassion, kindness, humility, mildness, and patience. . . . Clothe yourselves with
love, for it is a perfect bond of
union.—Col. 3:12, 14.
Genuine love and unity identify
Jehovah’s servants as the ones who
practice the true religion, for Jesus
said: “By this all will know that you
are my disciples—if you have love
among yourselves.” (John 13:34, 35)
And the apostle John wrote: “The
children of God and the children of
the Devil are evident by this fact:
Whoever does not practice righteousness does not originate with
God, nor does the one who does not
love his brother. For this is the message that you have heard from the
beginning, that we should love
one another.” (1 John 3:10, 11)
Love that results in extraordinary
unity marks Jehovah’s Witnesses
as Christ’s true followers, the ones
whom God is using to serve his purpose to have the good news of the
Kingdom preached in all the inhabited earth.—Matt. 24:14. w15 11/15 4:

Sunday, December 24
Like apples of gold in silver carvings is a word spoken at the right
time.—Prov. 25:11.
Since cultures and religious beliefs vary greatly, we need to be discerning when it comes to choosing
the right time to speak. And there
are many occasions when we may
need to discern that. For example,
someone may o?end us, even with
well-intentioned words. It would be
prudent on our part to take time to
re?ect on whether the matter is serious enough to say something. If
we must speak, it would not be wise
to approach the o?ender when we
are upset and perhaps might speak
a bit rashly. (Prov. 15:28) Similarly, we need to be discerning when
speaking about the truth to our unbelieving relatives. We want them to
come to know Jehovah, but we must
be patient and perceptive. Speaking the right words at the right time
may help to open their hearts.

It trains us . . . to live with soundness of mind . . . amid this present
system of things.—Titus 2:12.
Having “soundness of mind,” or
being sober-minded, should certainly come into play when the explanation of a diagnostic method or therapy seems strange or mysterious.
Can the practitioner or the one promoting it explain satisfactorily how it
works? Is it in accord with known
facts, and do numerous quali?ed
people view it as credible? (Prov. 22:
29) Or is the main appeal to the emotions? Perhaps the claim is that it

was discovered or used in a distant
or remote place, as if hidden from
modern research. Does such a claim
prove anything or even seem reasonable? Some diagnostic devices or
forms of treatment are described as
using a ‘secret substance’ or ‘body
force.’ That warrants serious caution because God warned against
“the use of magical power” and spirit mediums.—Isa. 1:13; Deut. 18:10-12.

Tuesday, December 26
There has not been raised up anyone greater than John the Baptist,
but a lesser person in the Kingdom
of the heavens is greater than he
is.—Matt. 11:11.
Throughout the Scriptures, we
see many examples of men of
faith who were deeply moved by
holy spirit; yet they did not have the
hope of living in heaven. John the
Baptist was one such person. Jesus
highly praised him but stated that
John would not be included in the
heavenly Kingdom. David was likewise moved by holy spirit. (1 Sam.
16:13) He was a man of great spiritual depth and was even inspired
to write sections of the Bible.
(Mark 12:36) Still, at Pentecost, Peter said of David that he “did not
ascend to the heavens.” (Acts 2:34)
Holy spirit worked mightily in
such ones, but it did not give
them the special witness that they
had been selected for heavenly life.
That did not mean that they were
in some way unworthy or de?cient.
It simply meant that Jehovah would
resurrect them to life on a paradise
earth.—John 5:28, 29; Acts 24:15.

I and the Father are one.
—John 10:30.
When we work along with those
we love, we draw close to them and
come to know their personality and
their qualities. We learn not only
what they want to accomplish but
also how they go about doing it. Jesus worked along with Jehovah for
perhaps billions of years, and they
forged a strong, unbreakable bond
of love and a?ection for each other.
They enjoyed a wonderful unity, always working together in full harmony. In prayer, Jesus asked Jehovah to watch over his disciples. The
reason? He prayed: “So that they
may be one just as we are one.”
(John 17:11) As we conform to God’s
standards and share in the work of
preaching, we come to understand
his appealing qualities. We learn
why it is wise to trust in him and
to follow his direction. As we draw
close to God, he draws close to us.
(Jas. 4:8) We also draw close to our
spiritual brothers and sisters because we face similar challenges
and joys and because we share the
same goals. w16.01 5:9, 10

Return with your sister-in-law.
—Ruth 1:15.
Naomi is determined to press on
to her homeland, Israel. With her
is Ruth, who faces what may be the
most important decision of her life.
She can either go home to her people in Moab or stick with her
mother-in-law, Naomi, and travel
to Bethlehem. (Ruth 1:1-8, 14) Ruth
could easily have reasoned that she
had a family there in Moab—a mother and other relatives who would
take a young widow in and help pro-

vide for her. Moab was her homeland. Its culture was her culture,
its language her language, its people her people. Naomi could promise her no such advantages in Bethlehem. In fact, she advised Ruth to
stay in Moab. Naomi feared that she
could provide neither a husband
nor a home for her daughters-inlaw. What would Ruth do? Note the
contrast between her and Orpah,
who “returned to her people and her
gods.” (Ruth 1:9-15) Did Ruth want to
return to the false gods of her people? No, she did not. w16.02 2:4, 5

Friday, December 29
What is Jehovah requiring of you?
Only to exercise justice, to cherish loyalty, and to walk in modesty with your God!—Mic. 6:8.
In the dead of night, David and
Abishai silently make their way
through 3,000 sleeping troops. At
the center of the camp, the two men
?nd King Saul fast asleep. He has
journeyed to the Judean wilderness
in order to ?nd David and kill
him. Abishai whispers: “Let me pin
[Saul] to the ground with the spear
just once, and I will not need to do it
twice.” David’s reply is astonishing!
“Do not harm him, for who can lift
his hand against the anointed of Jehovah and remain innocent? . . . It is
unthinkable from Jehovah’s standpoint for me to lift my hand against
the anointed of Jehovah!” (1 Sam.
26:8-12) David understood what loyalty to God involves. He had no intention of harming Saul. Why not?
Because Saul was God’s anointed
king over Israel. Loyal servants of
Jehovah respect those whom he appoints. Indeed, Jehovah requires
that all of his people “cherish loyalty.” w16.02 4:1, 2

To do your will, O my God, is my
delight.—Ps. 40:8.

Do not become unevenly yoked
with unbelievers.—2 Cor. 6:14.

Are you a young person who
is considering baptism? If so, what
lies before you is the greatest privilege any human could have. However, baptism is a serious step. It
symbolizes your dedication—a solemn promise you make to Jehovah
that you will serve him forever by
putting his will above everything
else in your life. Understandably,
you should get baptized only when
you are quali?ed to make that decision, you have a personal desire
to do so, and you understand the
meaning of dedication. What if you
are not sure that you are ready for
baptism? Or what if you want to get
baptized but your parents feel that
you should wait, perhaps until you
gain more experience in Christian
living? In either case, do not be discouraged. Instead, use this opportunity to make progress so that, before long, you can get baptized.
w16.03 2:1, 2

Some now serving God were married when they learned the truth,
and their mate is not a Witness.
Still, applying Bible principles can
contribute to harmony in the family. That involves cooperating to
the greatest extent possible without
compromising. This may be challenging, but think of the possible reward. Also, in view of Satan’s attack
on the family today, it is vital for all
of God’s servants to maintain good
cooperation in their marriage. No
matter how long you have been married, give thought to what you personally can say or do to strengthen
your marriage. Older ones can even
assist younger members of the congregation in this regard. You might
on occasion invite a younger couple
to your home to share in family worship with you and your mate. While
the younger ones are with you, they
can observe that a?ection and harmony are important no matter how
long one has been married.—Titus 2:
3-7. w16.03 3:14, 15
